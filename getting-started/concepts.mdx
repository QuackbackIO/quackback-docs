# Core Concepts

Before diving in, here's how the pieces fit together. Understanding these concepts will help you get the most out of Quackback.

## Workspaces

A **workspace** is your Quackback instance. It's the container for all your boards, posts, team members, and settings.

Each self-hosted deployment is a single workspace. You configure its name, logo, branding, and domain during setup.

<Note>
Think of a workspace like your company's feedback hub. Everything lives here.
</Note>

## Boards

**Boards** keep different types of feedback organized. Without them, everything piles up in one place.

Common examples:
- Feature Requests
- Bug Reports
- Integrations
- Documentation

Each board has a name, URL slug (e.g., `/b/feature-requests`), optional description, and a public/private visibility toggle.

<Tip>
Start with just 2-3 boards. You can always add more later, but too many boards confuse users about where to post.
</Tip>

## Posts

A **post** is a single piece of feedback: an idea, request, or bug report. Posts belong to a board and include:

- **Title** - Brief summary of the feedback
- **Content** - Detailed description with rich text formatting (powered by Tiptap)
- **Status** - Where it is in your workflow
- **Tags** - Labels for extra organization
- **Votes** - How many users support this idea
- **Comments** - Discussion thread
- **Owner** - The team member responsible for this post
- **Official response** - A pinned reply from your team

Posts also track edit history, so you can see what changed and when.

### How Posts Move Through Your Workflow

```
Submitted → Under Review → Planned → In Progress → Shipped
    │
    └──→ Declined
```

When a post's status changes, subscribed users are notified automatically.

## Statuses

**Statuses** show users what's happening with their feedback. They're the stages in your workflow, organized into three categories:

| Category | Default Statuses | Purpose |
|----------|-----------------|---------|
| **Active** | Under Review, Planned, In Progress | Posts that need attention or are being worked on |
| **Complete** | Shipped | Posts that have been successfully addressed |
| **Closed** | Declined | Posts that won't be implemented |

You can create custom statuses like "In Design", "In Beta", or "Blocked" to match your actual workflow. Each status has a name, color, and a toggle to control whether it appears on the public roadmap.

<Tip>
Go to **Admin → Settings → Statuses** to customize your workflow.
</Tip>

## Tags

**Tags** let you categorize posts across boards. Unlike statuses (one per post), posts can have multiple tags.

Examples:
- `mobile`, `web`, `api` - by platform
- `high-priority`, `quick-win` - by priority
- `enterprise`, `free-tier` - by customer segment

Tags are global - they work across all boards. They're created on the fly as you use them, or automatically during CSV import.

## Roadmaps

A **roadmap** is a public view of what you're building. It shows posts grouped by status in a kanban-style layout.

You can create multiple roadmaps (e.g., "Product Roadmap", "API Roadmap") and control which are public or private.

Users can:
- See what's planned, in progress, and shipped
- Vote on upcoming features
- Subscribe to updates on specific items

<Note>
The roadmap only shows posts you've explicitly added to it. Not everything needs to be public - you control what's visible.
</Note>

## Voting

**Voting** lets users show what they want most. Each user gets one vote per post - it's a simple toggle, not a scale.

Why it matters:
- Prioritize based on actual demand
- Spot popular requests quickly
- Make data-driven decisions instead of guessing

Vote counts are displayed on posts and used for sorting (e.g., "Top Votes" in the admin inbox).

## Comments

**Comments** enable discussion on posts. They support:

- **Threaded replies** - Nested conversations under any comment
- **Official responses** - Pinned team replies that stand out visually
- **Reactions** - Emoji reactions on individual comments
- **Rich text** - Formatting support in comment content
- **Team badges** - Comments from team members are visually distinguished

## Changelog

The **changelog** is where you announce what you've shipped. Each entry has a title, rich text content, and an optional publish date.

- **Draft entries** are only visible to your team
- **Published entries** appear on the public changelog page
- Entries can be linked to the posts that inspired them

This closes the feedback loop: users can see their suggestions turn into shipped features.

## Users vs. Team Members

Quackback has two types of accounts with three roles:

### Portal Users (role: `user`)

Your customers and community members:
- Sign up through the public portal
- Submit feedback, vote, and comment
- Manage their notification preferences
- Authenticate via email OTP or OAuth

### Team Members (roles: `admin` or `member`)

Your internal team:
- Invited by workspace admins
- Access the admin dashboard
- Manage feedback, settings, and integrations

<Note>
Team members can also use the public portal like regular users, in addition to having admin access.
</Note>

| Capability | Portal User | Member | Admin |
|------------|:-----------:|:------:|:-----:|
| Submit feedback | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Vote & comment | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| View admin dashboard | | ✓ | ✓ |
| Manage feedback & statuses | | ✓ | ✓ |
| Add to roadmap | | ✓ | ✓ |
| Workspace settings | | | ✓ |
| Team management | | | ✓ |
| Integrations & API keys | | | ✓ |

## API Keys

**API keys** provide programmatic access to Quackback's REST API. Keys inherit the role of the team member who creates them - an admin's key has admin access, a member's key has member access.

Keys are prefixed with `qb_` and authenticated via the `Authorization: Bearer` header.

<Note>
API keys are created in **Admin → Settings → API Keys**. The full key is only shown once at creation - store it securely.
</Note>

## Webhooks

**Webhooks** let you receive real-time HTTP notifications when events occur in Quackback.

Each webhook specifies:
- A **URL** to receive POST requests
- Which **events** to listen for (e.g., `post.created`, `post.status_changed`, `comment.created`)
- Optional **board filtering** to only receive events from specific boards

Payloads are signed with HMAC-SHA256 so you can verify they came from Quackback.

## Integrations

**Integrations** connect Quackback to your other tools:

| Integration | What it does |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Slack** | Post notifications to channels when events occur |
| **Webhooks** | Send signed HTTP callbacks to any URL |
| **REST API** | Full programmatic access to all resources |
| **MCP** | AI agent integration via the Model Context Protocol |

You configure **event mappings** to control which events trigger notifications and where they go.

## Subscriptions & Notifications

Users can **subscribe** to posts to get updates when:
- The status changes
- New comments are added
- The team posts an official response

Notifications go to:
- In-app notification center
- Email (if configured)

<Info>
Users are automatically subscribed to posts they create or vote on. They can manage their preferences in account settings.
