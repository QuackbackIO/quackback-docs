# Core Concepts

Understanding the key concepts in Quackback will help you make the most of the platform.

## Workspaces

A **workspace** is your Quackback instance. It contains all your boards, posts, team members, and settings.

- Self-hosted deployments have one workspace per instance
- Each workspace has its own subdomain or custom domain

## Boards

**Boards** organize feedback into categories. Common examples:

- Feature Requests
- Bug Reports
- Integrations
- Documentation

Each board can be configured independently:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | Display name for the board |
| **Slug** | URL-friendly identifier (`/b/feature-requests`) |
| **Visibility** | Public or private |
| **Access Control** | Restrict by email domain (optional) |

## Posts

A **post** is a single piece of feedback. Posts belong to a board and have:

- **Title** - Brief summary of the feedback
- **Content** - Detailed description (rich text with formatting)
- **Status** - Current state in your workflow
- **Tags** - Labels for additional categorization
- **Votes** - Number of users who support this idea
- **Comments** - Discussion thread

### Post Lifecycle

```
Submitted → Under Review → Planned → In Progress → Shipped
    │
    └──→ Declined
```

## Statuses

**Statuses** represent the lifecycle stages of feedback. Default statuses include:

| Status | Description | On Roadmap |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Under Review | New feedback being evaluated | No |
| Planned | Approved and scheduled | Yes |
| In Progress | Currently being worked on | Yes |
| Shipped | Released to users | Yes |
| Declined | Won't be implemented | No |

<Tip>
You can create custom statuses to match your workflow. Go to Admin → Settings → Statuses to configure them.
</Tip>

## Tags

**Tags** provide additional categorization within boards. Unlike statuses, posts can have multiple tags.

Examples:
- `mobile`, `web`, `api`
- `high-priority`, `quick-win`
- `enterprise`, `free-tier`

## Roadmaps

A **roadmap** is a public view of your planned work. It displays posts grouped by status in a kanban-style layout.

Users can:
- See what's planned, in progress, and shipped
- Vote on upcoming features
- Subscribe to updates

## Voting

**Voting** lets users express interest in feedback. Each user gets one vote per post.

Votes help you:
- Prioritize based on demand
- Identify popular requests
- Make data-driven decisions

## Comments

**Comments** enable discussion on posts. Features include:

- **Threaded replies** - Nested conversations
- **Official responses** - Pinned team replies
- **Reactions** - Emoji reactions on comments
- **Rich text** - Formatting support

## Users vs. Members

Quackback has two types of accounts:

### Portal Users
- Sign up through the public portal
- Submit feedback, vote, and comment
- Manage notification preferences
- Authenticate via email OTP or OAuth

### Team Members
- Invited by workspace admins
- Access the admin dashboard
- Manage feedback, settings, and integrations
- Have roles: **Admin** or **Member**

<Note>
Team members can also interact with the public portal like regular users, in addition to having admin access.
</Note>

| Capability | Portal User | Member | Admin |
|------------|:-----------:|:------:|:-----:|
| Submit feedback | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Vote & comment | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| View admin dashboard | | ✓ | ✓ |
| Manage feedback | | ✓ | ✓ |
| Change statuses | | ✓ | ✓ |
| Workspace settings | | | ✓ |
| Team management | | | ✓ |
| Integrations | | | ✓ |

## Integrations

**Integrations** connect Quackback to external tools:

- **Slack** - Post notifications to channels
- **Webhooks** - Send events to any URL
- **Linear** - Sync with issue tracking (coming soon)

Integrations are configured with **event mappings** that define which events trigger notifications.

## Subscriptions & Notifications

Users can **subscribe** to posts to receive updates:

- Status changes
- New comments
- Official responses

Notifications are delivered via:
- In-app notification center
- Email (if configured)

<Info>
Users are automatically subscribed to posts they create or vote on. They can manage their notification preferences in their account settings.
