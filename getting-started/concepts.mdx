# Core Concepts

Here's how the pieces fit together. Understanding these five concepts is enough to get started.

## Workspaces

A **workspace** is your Quackback instance: the container for all your boards, posts, team members, and settings. Each self-hosted deployment is a single workspace.

## Boards

**Boards** keep different types of feedback organized. Common examples: "Feature Requests", "Bug Reports", "Integrations".

Each board has a name, URL slug (e.g., `/b/feature-requests`), and a public/private visibility toggle.

<Tip>
Start with 2-3 boards. You can always add more later, but too many boards confuse users about where to post.
</Tip>

## Posts

A **post** is a single piece of feedback: an idea, request, or bug report. Posts belong to a board and include a title, description, status, tags, votes, and comments.

Posts move through your workflow as your team triages them:

```
Open → Under Review → Planned → In Progress → Complete
  │
  └──→ Closed
```

When a post's status changes, subscribed users are notified automatically.

## Statuses

**Statuses** show users what's happening with their feedback. They're organized into three categories:

| Category | Default Statuses | Purpose |
|----------|-----------------|---------|
| **Active** | Open, Under Review, Planned, In Progress | Posts that need attention or are being worked on |
| **Complete** | Complete | Posts that have been addressed |
| **Closed** | Closed | Posts that won't be implemented |

You can [create custom statuses](/admin/statuses) like "In Design", "In Beta", or "Blocked" to match your workflow.

## Users & Roles

Quackback has two types of accounts with three roles:

| Capability | Portal User | Member | Admin |
|------------|:-----------:|:------:|:-----:|
| Submit feedback, vote, comment | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| View admin dashboard | | ✓ | ✓ |
| Manage feedback & statuses | | ✓ | ✓ |
| Workspace settings & integrations | | | ✓ |

**Portal users** are your customers. They sign up through the public portal. **Team members** are invited by admins and access the admin dashboard.

<Note>
Team members can also use the public portal like regular users.
