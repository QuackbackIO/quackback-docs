# Core Concepts

Before diving in, here's how the pieces fit together. Understanding these concepts will help you get the most out of Quackback.

## Workspaces

A **workspace** is your Quackback instance. It's the container for all your boards, posts, team members, and settings.

- Self-hosted deployments have one workspace per instance
- Each workspace gets its own subdomain or custom domain

<Note>
Think of a workspace like your company's feedback hub. Everything lives here.
</Note>

## Boards

Tired of feedback scattered everywhere? **Boards** keep different types of feedback organized.

Common examples:
- Feature Requests
- Bug Reports
- Integrations
- Documentation

Each board can be configured independently:

| Setting | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Name** | Display name for the board |
| **Slug** | URL-friendly identifier (`/b/feature-requests`) |
| **Visibility** | Public or private |
| **Access Control** | Restrict by email domain (optional) |

<Tip>
Start with just 2-3 boards. You can always add more later, but too many boards confuse users about where to post.
</Tip>

## Posts

A **post** is a single piece of feedback: an idea, request, or bug report. Posts belong to a board and include:

- **Title** - Brief summary of the feedback
- **Content** - Detailed description (with rich text formatting)
- **Status** - Where it is in your workflow
- **Tags** - Labels for extra organization
- **Votes** - How many users support this idea
- **Comments** - Discussion thread

### How Posts Move Through Your Workflow

```
Submitted → Under Review → Planned → In Progress → Shipped
    │
    └──→ Declined
```

## Statuses

**Statuses** show users what's happening with their feedback. They're the stages in your workflow.

By default, you get:

| Status | What it means | Shows on Roadmap? |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Under Review | New feedback being evaluated | No |
| Planned | Approved and scheduled | Yes |
| In Progress | Currently being worked on | Yes |
| Shipped | Released to users | Yes |
| Declined | Won't be implemented | No |

<Tip>
You can create custom statuses like "In Design", "In Beta", or "Blocked" to match your actual workflow. Go to **Admin → Settings → Statuses**.
</Tip>

## Tags

Need more organization within a board? **Tags** let you categorize posts. Unlike statuses, posts can have multiple tags.

Examples:
- `mobile`, `web`, `api`
- `high-priority`, `quick-win`
- `enterprise`, `free-tier`

## Roadmaps

A **roadmap** is a public view of what you're working on. It shows posts grouped by status in a kanban-style layout.

Users can:
- See what's planned, in progress, and shipped
- Vote on upcoming features
- Subscribe to updates on specific items

<Note>
The roadmap only shows posts you've explicitly added to it. Not everything needs to be public.
</Note>

## Voting

**Voting** lets users show what they want most. Each user gets one vote per post.

Why it matters:
- Prioritize based on actual demand
- Spot popular requests quickly
- Make data-driven decisions instead of guessing

## Comments

**Comments** enable discussion on posts. They support:

- **Threaded replies** - Nested conversations
- **Official responses** - Pinned team replies that stand out
- **Reactions** - Emoji reactions on comments
- **Rich text** - Formatting support

## Users vs. Team Members

Quackback has two types of accounts:

### Portal Users

These are your customers and community members:
- Sign up through the public portal
- Submit feedback, vote, and comment
- Manage their notification preferences
- Authenticate via email OTP or OAuth

### Team Members

These are your internal team:
- Invited by workspace admins
- Access the admin dashboard
- Manage feedback, settings, and integrations
- Have roles: **Admin** or **Member**

<Note>
Team members can also use the public portal like regular users, in addition to having admin access.
</Note>

| What they can do | Portal User | Member | Admin |
|------------------|:-----------:|:------:|:-----:|
| Submit feedback | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Vote & comment | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| View admin dashboard | | ✓ | ✓ |
| Manage feedback | | ✓ | ✓ |
| Change statuses | | ✓ | ✓ |
| Workspace settings | | | ✓ |
| Team management | | | ✓ |
| Integrations | | | ✓ |

## Integrations

**Integrations** connect Quackback to your other tools:

| Integration | What it does |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Slack** | Post notifications to channels |
| **Webhooks** | Send events to any URL |
| **Linear** | Sync with issue tracking (coming soon) |

You configure **event mappings** to control which events trigger notifications. For example, "notify Slack when a post gets 10+ votes."

## Subscriptions & Notifications

Users can **subscribe** to posts to get updates when:
- Status changes
- New comments are added
- The team posts an official response

Notifications go to:
- In-app notification center
- Email (if configured)

<Info>
Users are automatically subscribed to posts they create or vote on. They can manage their preferences in account settings.
