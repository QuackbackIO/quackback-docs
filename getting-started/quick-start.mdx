# Quick Start

Ready to try Quackback? You'll have it running in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- A domain or subdomain (for production)

## One-Command Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/quackbackio/quackback.git
cd quackback

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Start everything
docker compose up -d
```

Quackback is now running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## First-Time Setup

1. **Open the app** - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Create your workspace** - Follow the onboarding wizard
3. **Sign in** - Use `demo@example.com` (check the console for the OTP code in development)

<Tip>
In development mode, OTP codes are printed to the console instead of being sent via email. Watch your terminal output for the login code.
</Tip>

## Environment Configuration

Edit `.env` with your settings:

```bash
# Required
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/quackback"
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="your-32-character-secret-key-here"
BETTER_AUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
ROOT_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Email (optional - emails print to console if not configured)
EMAIL_SMTP_HOST="smtp.example.com"
EMAIL_SMTP_PORT="587"
EMAIL_SMTP_USER="your-smtp-user"
EMAIL_SMTP_PASS="your-smtp-password"
```

Generate a secure secret:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

<Warning>
Never commit your `.env` file to version control. The `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` should be a strong, unique value in production.
</Warning>

## What's Next?

### Configure for Production

For production deployments, you'll need to:

1. Set up a proper domain with HTTPS
2. Configure email delivery (SMTP or Resend)
3. Set strong secrets
4. Use a managed PostgreSQL database

See the [Docker Deployment Guide](/self-hosting/docker) for complete instructions.

### Explore the Platform

- **Create a board** - Go to Admin → Settings → Boards
- **Invite your team** - Go to Admin → Settings → Team
- **Customize branding** - Go to Admin → Settings → Branding
- **Connect Slack** - Go to Admin → Settings → Integrations

### Import Existing Feedback

Migrating from another platform? Quackback supports CSV import:

1. Go to Admin → Settings → Boards
2. Select a board
3. Click "Import from CSV"

See [Import & Export](/admin/import-export) for format details.

## Troubleshooting

### Port 3000 already in use

```bash
# Find and kill the process
lsof -i :3000
kill -9 <PID>
```

### Database connection failed

Ensure PostgreSQL is running:

```bash
docker compose ps
# Should show postgres container as "healthy"
```

<Note>
If the database container shows as "unhealthy", try running `docker compose down -v` to remove volumes and then `docker compose up -d` to start fresh.
</Note>

### Emails not sending

<Info>
In development, emails are printed to the console. For production, configure SMTP or Resend in your `.env` file.
