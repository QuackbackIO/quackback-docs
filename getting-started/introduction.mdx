# Introduction

Stop losing feedback across emails, Slack, and support tickets.

Quackback brings user requests, votes, and discussions into one place so you can see what users actually want and show them what you're building.

And it's open source. Run it on your own servers, own your data, and customize everything.

## Why Quackback?

Feedback is everywhere: support tickets, emails, tweets, Slack messages, spreadsheets. Your team wastes time hunting for it, and good ideas slip through the cracks.

Quackback gives you a single source of truth. Users submit feedback through a clean portal. Your team triages it in one place. Everyone sees what's planned and what's shipped.

**For your users:**
- Submit feedback through a branded portal
- Vote on ideas they care about
- Track progress on the public roadmap
- Get notified when their requests ship

**For your team:**
- Triage feedback in a unified inbox
- Organize with boards, tags, and statuses
- Plan releases with drag-and-drop roadmaps
- Connect to Slack, Linear, and other tools

## Key Features

### Feedback Boards

Keep feature requests separate from bug reports. Create boards for different types of feedback. Each can be public or private.

<Tip>
Start with 2-3 boards (like "Feature Requests" and "Bug Reports"). You can always add more later.
</Tip>

### Voting & Prioritization

Let users vote on what matters most. Sort by popularity, trending, or recency to see what's in demand.

### Custom Statuses

Your workflow isn't one-size-fits-all. Create statuses like "In Design", "In Beta", or "Blocked" to match how your team actually works.

### Public Roadmap

Show users what's coming. They can see what's planned, in progress, and shipped, and follow updates on features they voted for.

### Integrations
