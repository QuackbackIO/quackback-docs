# Introduction

Quackback is an open-source customer feedback platform that helps you collect, organize, and act on user feedback. Build public feedback boards, roadmaps, and changelogs to keep your users informed and engaged.

## Why Quackback?

Traditional feedback collection is fragmented—scattered across emails, support tickets, social media, and spreadsheets. Quackback centralizes everything in one place, giving your team a single source of truth for what users want.

**For your users:**
- Submit feedback through a clean, branded portal
- Vote on ideas they care about
- Track progress on the public roadmap
- Get notified when their requests ship

**For your team:**
- Triage feedback in a unified inbox
- Organize with boards, tags, and statuses
- Plan releases with drag-and-drop roadmaps
- Connect to Slack, Linear, and other tools

## Key Features

### Feedback Boards
Create multiple boards for different types of feedback—feature requests, bug reports, integrations, or anything else. Each board can be public or private.

### Voting & Prioritization
Let users vote on what matters most. Sort by popularity, trending, or recency to understand demand.

### Custom Statuses
Define your own workflow statuses (Planned, In Progress, Shipped) and track feedback through your process.

### Public Roadmap
Share your plans with a public roadmap. Users can see what's coming and follow updates on features they voted for.

### Integrations
Connect Quackback to your existing tools:
- **Slack** - Get notified about new feedback in your channels
- **Webhooks** - Send events to any HTTP endpoint
- **Linear** - Sync feedback to your issue tracker (coming soon)

### Self-Hosted
Run Quackback on your own infrastructure. Your data stays with you.
