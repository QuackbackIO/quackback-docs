# Introduction

Stop losing feedback across emails, Slack, and support tickets.

Quackback brings user requests, votes, and discussions into one place so you can see what users actually want and show them what you're building.

And it's open source. Run it on your own servers, own your data, and customize everything.

## Why Quackback?

Feedback is everywhere: support tickets, emails, tweets, Slack messages, spreadsheets. Your team wastes time hunting for it, and good ideas slip through the cracks.

Quackback gives you a single source of truth. Users submit feedback through a clean portal. Your team triages it in one place. Everyone sees what's planned and what's shipped.

**For your users:**
- Submit feedback through a branded portal
- Vote on ideas they care about
- Track progress on the public roadmap
- Get notified when their requests ship

**For your team:**
- Triage feedback in a unified inbox
- Organize with boards, tags, and statuses
- Plan releases with drag-and-drop roadmaps
- Automate workflows with webhooks and the REST API
- Connect to Slack and other tools

## Key Features

### Feedback Boards

Keep feature requests separate from bug reports. Create boards for different types of feedback. Each can be public or private.

<Tip>
Start with 2-3 boards (like "Feature Requests" and "Bug Reports"). You can always add more later.
</Tip>

### Voting & Prioritization

Let users vote on what matters most. Sort by popularity, trending, or recency to see what's in demand.

### Custom Statuses

Your workflow isn't one-size-fits-all. Create statuses like "In Design", "In Beta", or "Blocked" to match how your team actually works.

### Public Roadmap

Show users what's coming. They can see what's planned, in progress, and shipped, and follow updates on features they voted for.

### Changelog

Announce what you've shipped. Link changelog entries to the posts that inspired them so users can see their feedback turned into features.

### REST API & API Keys

Automate your feedback workflow with a full [REST API](/api/overview). Create API keys scoped to your team role, then build custom integrations, sync data to your issue tracker, or power internal dashboards.

### Webhooks

Get real-time HTTP notifications when things happen - new posts, status changes, comments. Filter by board, verify with HMAC-SHA256 signatures, and connect to any system.

### AI Agent Support (MCP)

Quackback includes a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) server, so AI coding agents like Claude Code can search feedback, triage posts, update statuses, and create changelog entries directly.

### Integrations

Connect Quackback to your existing tools:

| Integration | Status | What it does |
|-------------|--------|--------------|

| **REST API** | Available | Full CRUD access to all resources |
| **MCP** | Available | AI agent integration for feedback triage |
