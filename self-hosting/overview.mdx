# Self-Hosting

Quackback is designed to be self-hosted. Pick the deployment method that fits your setup.

## Choose your path

| Method | Best for | Time |
|--------|----------|------|
| [Railway](/docs/self-hosting/railway) | Fastest start, no server needed | 2 min |
| [Docker](/docs/self-hosting/docker) | Most deployments | 10 min |
| [Manual](/docs/self-hosting/manual) | Full control, no containers | 30 min |

<Tip>
If you're not sure, start with Docker. It handles dependencies, migrations, and updates automatically.
</Tip>

## Before you start

Check the [system requirements](/docs/self-hosting/requirements). You need PostgreSQL 18+, Redis or Dragonfly, and about 1 GB of RAM.
