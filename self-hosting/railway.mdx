# Deploy to Railway

Railway handles infrastructure so you can focus on collecting feedback. One click gives you Quackback, PostgreSQL, and Redis with automatic SSL, deployments on push, and no server management.

## Prerequisites

- A [Railway](https://railway.app) account (free tier available)
- A domain or subdomain for your instance (e.g., `feedback.yourcompany.com`)

## One-Click Deploy

Click the button below to deploy Quackback to Railway:

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/quackback)

The template provisions three services:

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Quackback** | The application server |
| **PostgreSQL** | Database with `pgvector` extension |
| **Redis** | Background job queue (BullMQ) |

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to configure each service yourself:

### 1. Create a New Project

1. Go to [railway.app/new](https://railway.app/new)
2. Click **Empty Project**

### 2. Add PostgreSQL

1. Click **+ New** → **Database** → **PostgreSQL**
2. Railway provisions a PostgreSQL instance automatically

<Note>
Quackback requires the `pgvector` extension. Railway's PostgreSQL supports it. Run `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;` via the Railway console if migrations don't create it automatically.
</Note>

### 3. Add Redis

1. Click **+ New** → **Database** → **Redis**
2. Railway provisions a Redis instance automatically

### 4. Deploy Quackback

1. Click **+ New** → **GitHub Repo**
2. Connect the `quackbackio/quackback` repository (or your fork)
3. Railway detects the Dockerfile and builds automatically

### 5. Configure Environment Variables

In the Quackback service settings, add these variables:

```bash
# Railway injects DATABASE_URL and REDIS_URL automatically if you link the services.
# If not linked, set them manually:
DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
REDIS_URL=${{Redis.REDIS_URL}}

# Authentication (generate with: openssl rand -base64 32)
SECRET_KEY="your-32-character-minimum-secret-key"

# Public URL (set after assigning a domain)
BASE_URL="https://feedback.yourcompany.com"
```

### 6. Link Services

1. Go to the Quackback service → **Variables**
2. Click **Add Reference** to link `DATABASE_URL` from the PostgreSQL service
3. Click **Add Reference** to link `REDIS_URL` from the Redis service

### 7. Add a Domain

1. Go to the Quackback service → **Settings** → **Networking**
2. Click **Generate Domain** for a Railway subdomain, or **Custom Domain** for your own
3. If using a custom domain, add a CNAME record pointing to Railway
4. Update `BASE_URL` to match

<Tip>
Railway provides automatic SSL for all domains. No certificate configuration needed.
</Tip>

## Email Configuration

Without email, OTP codes are printed to Railway logs. For production, configure SMTP or Resend:

```bash
# SMTP
EMAIL_SMTP_HOST="smtp.example.com"
EMAIL_SMTP_PORT="587"
EMAIL_SMTP_USER="your-username"
EMAIL_SMTP_PASS="your-password"
EMAIL_FROM="feedback@yourcompany.com"

# Or Resend
EMAIL_RESEND_API_KEY="re_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
EMAIL_FROM="feedback@yourcompany.com"
```

## File Storage

For image uploads, configure S3-compatible storage:

```bash
S3_ENDPOINT="https://your-s3-endpoint"
S3_BUCKET="quackback-uploads"
S3_ACCESS_KEY="your-access-key"
S3_SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key"
S3_REGION="us-east-1"
```

<Tip>
Railway doesn't provide persistent file storage. Use an external S3-compatible service like AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, or Backblaze B2 for file uploads.
</Tip>

## Upgrades

Railway rebuilds and redeploys automatically when you push to the connected branch. Migrations run on every startup, so schema changes are applied automatically.

To upgrade a template deployment:

1. Fork the Quackback repository if you haven't already
2. Pull the latest changes from upstream
3. Push to your fork — Railway redeploys automatically

## Monitoring

### Logs

View real-time logs in the Railway dashboard:

1. Go to your Quackback service
2. Click **Deployments** → select the active deployment
3. Click **View Logs**

### Health Check

Railway can restart the service if it becomes unhealthy:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Deploy**
2. Set the health check path to `/api/health`

## Cost

Railway bills based on usage. A typical Quackback instance costs $5–20/month depending on traffic:

| Resource | Estimate |
|----------|----------|
| Quackback (512 MB RAM) | ~$5/mo |
| PostgreSQL | ~$5/mo |
| Redis | ~$2/mo |

<Note>
Railway's free trial includes $5 of usage. After that, the Hobby plan starts at $5/month with $5 of included usage.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

Check the build logs for errors. Common causes:
- Missing environment variables — ensure `DATABASE_URL` and `SECRET_KEY` are set
- Docker build issues — Railway uses the repository's Dockerfile

### Database Connection Failed

1. Verify the PostgreSQL service is running
2. Check that `DATABASE_URL` references the correct service
3. Try restarting the Quackback service

### "Port Already in Use"

Railway assigns a port via the `PORT` environment variable. Quackback reads this automatically. Do not hardcode a port.
