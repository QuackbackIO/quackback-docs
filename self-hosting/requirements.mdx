# System Requirements

Hardware, software, and infrastructure requirements for self-hosting Quackback.

## Minimum Requirements

| Resource | Minimum | Recommended |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| CPU | 1 core | 2+ cores |
| RAM | 1 GB | 2+ GB |
| Storage | 10 GB | 20+ GB |
| PostgreSQL | 17+ | 17+ |

## Software Requirements

### PostgreSQL

**Version**: 17 or higher (required)

**Required Extensions**:
- `pgvector` - Vector similarity search
- `pg_cron` - Scheduled jobs (optional)


### Docker (Recommended)

| Component | Version |
|-----------|---------|
| Docker Engine | 20.10+ |
| Docker Compose | v2+ |

### Bun (Alternative)

If running without Docker:

| Component | Version |
|-----------|---------|
| Bun | 1.3.7+ |

## Network Requirements

### Ports

| Port | Purpose | Required |
|------|---------|----------|
| 3000 | Application (default) | Yes |
| 5432 | PostgreSQL | Internal only |
| 443 | HTTPS (via proxy) | Production |
| 80 | HTTP redirect | Optional |

### Domains

You need:
- A domain or subdomain (e.g., `feedback.yourcompany.com`)
- SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt works great)

### Outbound Connections

Quackback needs to reach:
- Email provider (SMTP or Resend API)
- OAuth providers (GitHub, Google, etc.)
- Integration services (Slack, etc.)

## Database Requirements

### PostgreSQL Configuration

Recommended settings for production:

```ini
# Memory
shared_buffers = 256MB
work_mem = 16MB
maintenance_work_mem = 128MB

# Connections
max_connections = 100

# WAL
wal_level = replica
```

### Storage

Estimate storage needs:

| Data | Size Estimate |
|------|---------------|
| 1,000 posts | ~50 MB |
| 10,000 posts | ~500 MB |
| 100,000 posts | ~5 GB |

Add headroom for:
- Attachments (if enabled)
- Vector embeddings (for AI features)
- Logs and backups

### Backups

<Warning>
Plan for regular backups to prevent data loss. Point-in-time recovery is recommended for production deployments.
</Warning>

- Daily full backups
- Point-in-time recovery (recommended)
- Off-site backup storage

## Cloud Provider Options

### AWS

| Service | Use |
|---------|-----|
| EC2 | Application server |
| RDS | Managed PostgreSQL |
| ElastiCache | Optional caching |
| ALB | Load balancing |

Minimum instance: `t3.small`

### Google Cloud

| Service | Use |
|---------|-----|
| Compute Engine | Application server |
| Cloud SQL | Managed PostgreSQL |
| Cloud Load Balancing | Load balancing |

Minimum machine: `e2-small`

### DigitalOcean

| Service | Use |
|---------|-----|
| Droplet | Application server |
| Managed Database | PostgreSQL |
| Load Balancer | Optional |

Minimum droplet: 2GB RAM

### Railway / Render / Fly.io

All support Quackback with managed databases.

## VPS Providers

Budget-friendly options:

| Provider | Minimum Plan |
|----------|--------------|
| Hetzner | CX21 (2GB RAM) |
| Vultr | 2GB plan |
| Linode | Nanode 2GB |
| DigitalOcean | Basic 2GB |

## Security Requirements

### TLS/SSL

- Required for production
- Use Let's Encrypt (free) or commercial cert
- Minimum TLS 1.2

### Firewall

Allow only:
- 443 (HTTPS)
- 80 (HTTP, redirect to HTTPS)
- 22 (SSH, restricted IPs)

Block:
- Direct database access
- Application port from public

### Secrets

<Warning>
Securely manage all secrets including `SECRET_KEY`, database credentials, OAuth client secrets, and integration tokens. Use environment variables or a secrets management solution.
</Warning>

## Scaling Considerations

### Single Server

Suitable for:
- Up to 10,000 users
- Moderate traffic

### Horizontal Scaling

For higher loads:
- Multiple application instances
- Load balancer
- Shared PostgreSQL
- Session storage (database-backed)

### Database Scaling

Options:
- Vertical scaling (bigger instance)
- Read replicas (for read-heavy loads)
- Connection pooling (PgBouncer)

## Monitoring Recommendations

### Application

- Health check endpoint
- Error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
- Request latency

### Database

- Connection count
- Query performance
- Disk usage

### Infrastructure

- CPU utilization
- Memory usage
- Disk I/O
- Network throughput

## Next Steps

- [Docker Deployment](/self-hosting/docker) - Quick start with Docker
- [Manual Installation](/self-hosting/manual) - Install with Bun
- [Configuration](/reference/environment-variables) - Environment variables
