# Linear Integration

<Note>
**Status: Community Contribution Welcome**

The Linear integration is not yet built, though configuration variables are already in place. If you'd like to contribute, the architecture is ready - Quackback's event system makes adding new integrations straightforward.
</Note>

## Planned Features

The Linear integration would enable:

- **Create Linear issues from feedback posts** - Turn high-voted posts into actionable issues
- **Status sync** - Map Quackback statuses to Linear workflow states
- **Backlink comments** - Automatically link between both platforms

### Status Mapping

| Quackback Status | Linear State |
|------------------|--------------|
| Under Review | Backlog |
| Planned | Todo |
| In Progress | In Progress |
| Shipped | Done |

## Configuration

The environment variables are already defined in `.env.example`:

```bash
LINEAR_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id"
LINEAR_CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret"
```

Create a Linear OAuth application at [Linear Settings > API](https://linear.app/settings/api).

## Workaround: Use Webhooks

You can connect Quackback to Linear today using [webhooks](/integrations/webhooks):

1. Create a small middleware service
2. Set up a Quackback webhook for `post.status_changed` events
3. Use the [Linear API](https://developers.linear.app) to create or update issues

## Contributing

If you'd like to build the native Linear integration:

- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/quackbackio/quackback/issues) - Check for an existing issue or create one
- [Contributing Guide](/developers/contributing) - How to contribute
- The Slack integration in `packages/integrations/` is a good reference implementation

## Next Steps

- [Webhooks](/integrations/webhooks) - Build custom integrations now
- [Slack](/integrations/slack) - Built-in Slack notification integration
- [Integrations Overview](/integrations/overview) - All integrations
