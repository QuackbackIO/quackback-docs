# Linear Integration

Sync feedback with Linear issues for seamless project management.

<Warning>
**Status: Coming Soon**

The Linear integration is planned but not yet implemented. This page outlines the planned functionality.
</Warning>

## Planned Features

### Two-Way Sync

Connect feedback posts to Linear issues:

- Create Linear issues from feedback posts
- Link existing issues to posts
- Sync status changes between platforms

### Automatic Issue Creation

Configure rules to automatically create Linear issues:

- When posts reach a certain status (e.g., "Planned")
- When posts are in specific boards
- When posts receive enough votes

### Status Mapping

Map Quackback statuses to Linear workflow states:

| Quackback Status | Linear State |
|------------------|--------------|
| Under Review | Backlog |
| Planned | Todo |
| In Progress | In Progress |
| Shipped | Done |

### Backlink Comments

When a Linear issue is created:

- Add a comment on the Quackback post with the issue link
- Add a comment on the Linear issue linking to the feedback

## Planned Setup Flow

### 1. Connect to Linear

1. Navigate to **Admin > Settings > Integrations**
2. Click **Linear**
3. Click **Connect to Linear**
4. Authorize Quackback in Linear
5. Select your Linear workspace

### 2. Configure Sync Settings

1. Choose default team for new issues
2. Map statuses between platforms
3. Configure automatic issue creation rules

### 3. Configure Event Mappings

Choose which events trigger Linear actions:

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Post status changed to "Planned" | Create issue |
| Post merged | Link to existing issue |
| Linear issue completed | Update post status |

## Self-Hosted Configuration

For self-hosted instances, configure Linear OAuth credentials:

```bash
# .env
LINEAR_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id"
LINEAR_CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret"
```

<Note>
Create a Linear OAuth application:

1. Go to [Linear Settings > API](https://linear.app/settings/api)
2. Create a new OAuth application
3. Set redirect URI to `https://your-domain.com/api/integrations/linear/callback`
4. Copy the client ID and secret
</Note>

## Feature Request

<Tip>
Want Linear integration sooner? Let us know:

- Vote for the feature on our [roadmap](https://github.com/quackback/quackback/discussions)
- Share your use case in the discussions
- Contribute to the implementation
</Tip>

## Technical Notes

The Linear integration will follow the same hook architecture as existing integrations:

- OAuth2 for authentication
- Encrypted token storage with workspace-specific keys
- Bidirectional sync via Linear webhooks
- Event-driven updates through the hook system

### API Scopes

The integration will request these Linear API scopes:

| Scope | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `read` | Read issues and projects |
| `write` | Create and update issues |
| `issues:create` | Create new issues |

## Alternative: Manual Linking

While waiting for native Linear support:

1. Copy the feedback post URL
2. Paste it in the Linear issue description
3. Reference the Linear issue in a Quackback comment

## Next Steps

- [Slack](/integrations/slack) - Currently available integration
- [Webhooks](/integrations/webhooks) - Build custom integrations
- [Integrations Overview](/integrations/overview) - All integrations
