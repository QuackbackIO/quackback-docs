# n8n

Automate on your terms. Connect Quackback to your self-hosted n8n instance to trigger workflows when feedback is submitted, statuses change, or comments are added. Keep your automation pipelines on your own infrastructure with full control.

## Overview

The n8n integration enables:

- **Trigger workflows** -- trigger n8n workflows when feedback is submitted, statuses change, or comments are added
- **Self-hosted automation** -- keep your automation pipelines on your own infrastructure with full control

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to your Quackback workspace
- An [n8n](https://n8n.io) instance (self-hosted or cloud)
- A webhook node set up in n8n

## Setup

### 1. Create a Webhook in n8n

1. Open n8n and create a new workflow
2. Add a **Webhook** node as the trigger
3. Set the HTTP method to **POST**
4. Copy the **webhook URL** (production URL, not the test URL)

<Tip>
Use the **production webhook URL** from n8n, not the test URL. The test URL only works when n8n is in listening mode, while the production URL works whenever the workflow is active.
</Tip>

### 2. Connect in Quackback

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > n8n**
2. Click **Connect**
3. Paste the n8n webhook URL
4. Click **Save**

### 3. Configure Events

Choose which events trigger your n8n workflow:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| New post | Someone submits new feedback |
| Status change | Post status is updated |
| New comment | Comment added to a post |

### 4. Test the Connection

1. Activate your n8n workflow
2. Submit test feedback in Quackback
3. Check the n8n execution history to verify the webhook was received
4. Use the received data to configure the rest of your workflow

## Payload Format

Quackback sends a JSON payload to your n8n webhook. The payload includes event details, post data, author information, and board context. Use n8n's expression editor to map fields to downstream nodes.

## Example Workflows

### Feedback to Database

1. **Trigger**: Quackback webhook (new post)
2. **Action**: Postgres/MySQL node > Insert row
3. Map fields: title, description, author email, board name

### Slack Alert for Bug Reports

1. **Trigger**: Quackback webhook (new post)
2. **Filter**: IF node checking board name equals "Bug Reports"
3. **Action**: Slack node > Send message

### Sync to Airtable

1. **Trigger**: Quackback webhook (all events)
2. **Action**: Airtable node > Create/Update record
3. Map fields and use the event type to determine the action

## Manage the Integration

### Pause

Temporarily stop sending events:

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > n8n**
2. Toggle **Enabled** off
3. Events stop, but the webhook URL is preserved

### Disconnect

To fully remove the integration:

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > n8n**
2. Click **Disconnect**
3. Confirm the action

<Note>
Disconnecting in Quackback does not affect your n8n workflow. You can deactivate or delete it separately in n8n.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### Events Not Arriving in n8n

1. **Check integration status** -- look for errors in Quackback settings
2. **Verify webhook URL** -- ensure the URL is HTTPS
3. **Check workflow status** -- ensure the n8n workflow is active (not just saved)
4. **Check n8n logs** -- review execution history for errors

### Using a Test URL

If you pasted the n8n **test URL** (contains `/webhook-test/`), events will only arrive when n8n is in listening mode. Switch to the **production URL** (contains `/webhook/`) for reliable delivery.

### Self-Hosted n8n Not Reachable

Your n8n instance must be accessible from the internet for Quackback to send webhooks. If self-hosting behind a firewall, ensure the webhook endpoint is exposed via a reverse proxy or tunnel.
