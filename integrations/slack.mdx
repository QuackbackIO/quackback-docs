# Slack

Feedback where you work. Get notified in Slack channels the moment new feedback arrives, statuses change, or users comment. Route different events to different channels based on board, status, or priority.

## Overview

The Slack integration sends notifications to channels when:
- New feedback is submitted
- Post status changes
- New comments are posted

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to your Quackback workspace
- Permission to install apps in your Slack workspace

## Setup

### 1. Start the Connection

1. Go to **Admin → Settings → Integrations**
2. Click **Slack**
3. Click **Connect to Slack**

### 2. Authorize the App

You'll be redirected to Slack:

1. Select your Slack workspace
2. Review the permissions requested
3. Click **Allow**

### 3. Select a Channel

Back in Quackback:

1. Choose a default channel for notifications
2. Select from public channels or private channels the app was added to

### 4. Configure Events

Choose which events trigger Slack notifications:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| New post | Someone submits new feedback |
| Status change | Post status is updated |
| New comment | Comment added to a post |

### 5. Save and Test

1. Click **Save**
2. Click **Send Test** to verify the connection
3. Check your Slack channel for the test message

## Notification Format

Slack notifications use Block Kit formatting for rich messages.

**New post:**
```
📬 New feedback from jane@example.com

> "Add dark mode support"
> It would be great to have a dark mode...

in feature-requests
```

**Status change:**
```
🔄 Status changed by admin@example.com

> "Add dark mode support"
> Under Review → Planned
```

**New comment:**
```
💬 New comment from jane@example.com

> "Add dark mode support"
> Great idea! We're considering this for Q2.
```

All notifications include clickable links to the post.

## Event Mapping

Send different events to different channels:

1. Go to the Slack integration settings
2. Click **Add Event Mapping**
3. Configure:
   - **Event type**: post.created, post.status_changed, etc.
   - **Channel**: Target Slack channel
   - **Filters** (optional): Board, status, or other conditions

### Example Configurations

**All new feedback to #product-feedback:**
- Event: post.created
- Channel: #product-feedback

**Only "Shipped" items to #shipped:**
- Event: post.status_changed
- Channel: #shipped
- Filter: Status = "Shipped"

**Bug reports to #bugs:**
- Event: post.created
- Channel: #bugs
- Filter: Board = "Bug Reports"

## Private Channels

To post to private channels:

1. In Slack, open the private channel
2. Type `/invite @Quackback` or use channel settings
3. The channel now appears in Quackback's channel selector

## Manage the integration

### Pause Notifications

Temporarily stop notifications:

1. Go to **Admin → Settings → Integrations → Slack**
2. Toggle **Enabled** off
3. Notifications pause, but the connection remains

### Reconnect

If you see connection errors:

1. Click **Reconnect**
2. Re-authorize in Slack
3. Reconfigure channels if needed

### Disconnect

To fully remove the integration:

1. Go to **Admin → Settings → Integrations → Slack**
2. Click **Disconnect**
3. Confirm the action

<Note>
This removes the connection but doesn't uninstall the app from Slack.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Appearing

1. **Check integration status** - Look for errors in settings
2. **Verify channel** - Ensure the channel still exists
3. **Check event mappings** - Confirm events are configured
4. **App permissions** - Verify the app is in the channel

### "Channel Not Found" Error

The channel may have been:
- Deleted
- Made private (app needs re-invitation)
- Renamed (select it again in settings)

### "Token Expired" Error

1. Click **Reconnect**
2. Re-authorize the app in Slack
3. Test the connection

### Duplicate Notifications

Check for:
- Multiple event mappings for the same event
- Multiple Slack integrations connected

## Permissions

The Slack app requests:

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `channels:read` | List public channels |
| `groups:read` | List private channels (when invited) |
| `channels:join` | Auto-join public channels for posting |
| `chat:write` | Post notifications |
| `team:read` | Get workspace info |

<Note>
The app cannot:
- Read your messages
- Access private channels (unless invited)
- Post as individual users
</Note>

## Best Practices

### Dedicated Channel

<Tip>
Create a `#product-feedback` channel specifically for Quackback notifications. This keeps feedback organized, prevents noise in other channels, and makes it easy to find feedback history.
</Tip>

### Smart Filtering

Don't send everything to one channel. Instead:
- Route by board (bugs vs features)
- Filter by status (only shipped items)
- Use separate channels for high-priority items

### React to Notifications

Use Slack's reaction emojis:
- 👀 to indicate you've seen it
- ✅ when handled
- 📌 for important items

### Link to Posts

Slack notifications include links back to Quackback. Click through to:
- Add comments
- Change status
- See full context
