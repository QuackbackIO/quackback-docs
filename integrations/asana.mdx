# Asana

Turn feedback into tasks. Automatically create Asana tasks when feedback is submitted, and keep statuses synchronized between Quackback and Asana. When a task moves between sections in your Asana project, the linked feedback post updates too.

## Overview

The Asana integration enables:

- **Create Asana tasks from feedback posts** -- automatically create a task when new feedback is submitted
- **Link posts to tasks** -- link feedback posts to Asana tasks for traceability
- **Status sync** -- keep feedback status in sync with Asana task sections via inbound webhooks

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to your Quackback workspace
- An Asana account with access to the target workspace
- An Asana OAuth application (created at [Asana Developer Console](https://developers.asana.com/docs/oauth))

## Setup

### 1. Create an Asana OAuth Application

1. Go to [Asana Developer Console](https://developers.asana.com/docs/oauth)
2. Create a new OAuth application
3. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### 2. Configure Platform Credentials

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Asana**
2. Enter the following credentials:
   - **Client ID** from your Asana OAuth application
   - **Client Secret** from your Asana OAuth application

### 3. Connect Your Workspace

1. Click **Connect to Asana**
2. You'll be redirected to Asana to authorize the application
3. Review the permissions and click **Allow**

After authorization, Quackback automatically detects your Asana workspace.

### 4. Select a Project

Back in Quackback:

1. Choose the Asana project where tasks should be created
2. Only active (non-archived) projects are shown

### 5. Configure Status Mappings

Map Asana sections to Quackback statuses:

1. Go to the Asana integration settings
2. Configure status mappings between Asana section names and Quackback statuses
3. Each Asana section name can be mapped to a corresponding Quackback status, or set to ignore

Status sync works via Asana webhooks. When a linked Asana task is moved to a different section, the corresponding Quackback post status updates automatically.

### 6. Configure Events

Choose which events trigger Asana actions:

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| New post | Create an Asana task with the feedback details |

<Note>
The Asana integration currently creates tasks only for `post.created` events. Status changes and comments are handled through the status sync mechanism rather than creating new tasks.
</Note>

### 7. Save and Test

1. Click **Save**
2. Submit test feedback to verify a task is created in Asana

## Task Format

When a new feedback post triggers task creation, the Asana task includes:

- **Name**: The feedback post title
- **Notes** (HTML): The post content, followed by metadata including the author, board, vote count, and a link back to the post in Quackback

The task is created in the selected project within your connected Asana workspace.

## Status Sync

When status sync is configured, Quackback registers a webhook with Asana to receive task change events. Asana uses sections within a project as status indicators. When a linked task is moved to a different section:

1. Asana sends a compact webhook event to Quackback
2. Quackback fetches the task details via the Asana API to determine the current section
3. If a status mapping exists for that section name, the linked feedback post's status is updated

The webhook uses Asana's handshake protocol -- the initial setup request includes an `X-Hook-Secret` header that Quackback echoes back. Subsequent events are verified using HMAC-SHA256 via the `X-Hook-Signature` header.

The webhook is filtered to only receive task change events related to section membership, keeping traffic minimal.

## Manage the integration

### Pause

Temporarily stop the integration:

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Asana**
2. Toggle **Enabled** off
3. Task creation and status sync pause, but the connection remains

### Reconnect

If you see connection errors:

1. Click **Reconnect**
2. Re-authorize in Asana
3. Tokens are automatically refreshed when they expire (Asana access tokens last approximately one hour)

### Disconnect

To fully remove the integration:

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Asana**
2. Click **Disconnect**
3. Confirm the action

<Note>
Disconnecting revokes the OAuth token with Asana and removes the registered webhook.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### Tasks Not Being Created

1. **Check integration status** -- look for errors in settings
2. **Verify project selection** -- ensure an Asana project is selected
3. **Check event mappings** -- confirm `post.created` is mapped
4. **Workspace access** -- the connected Asana account must have access to the selected project

### Status Sync Not Working

1. **Check status mappings** -- ensure Asana section names are mapped to Quackback statuses
2. **Verify webhook** -- the Asana webhook may need to be re-registered
3. **Section-based status** -- Asana uses sections (not custom fields) as the status indicator for sync

### "Authentication Failed" Error

Asana OAuth access tokens expire after approximately one hour and are automatically refreshed. If refresh fails:

1. Click **Reconnect**
2. Re-authorize the app in Asana
