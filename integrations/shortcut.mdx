# Shortcut

Turn feedback into stories. Automatically create Shortcut stories when feedback is submitted, and keep statuses synchronized between Quackback and Shortcut. When a story's workflow state changes in Shortcut, the linked feedback post updates too.

## Overview

The Shortcut integration enables:

- **Create Shortcut stories from feedback posts** -- automatically create a story when new feedback is submitted
- **Link posts to stories** -- link feedback posts to Shortcut stories for traceability
- **Status sync** -- keep feedback post status and Shortcut story workflow state in sync via inbound webhooks

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to your Quackback workspace
- A Shortcut workspace
- A Shortcut API token (generated at [Shortcut Settings > API Tokens](https://app.shortcut.com/settings/account/api-tokens))

## Setup

### 1. Generate a Shortcut API Token

1. Go to [Shortcut Settings > API Tokens](https://app.shortcut.com/settings/account/api-tokens)
2. Generate a new API token
3. Copy the token

<Note>
Shortcut uses API token authentication rather than OAuth. No application registration is required.
</Note>

### 2. Connect Your Workspace

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Shortcut**
2. Enter your **API Token**
3. Click **Save**

Quackback validates the token by checking it against the Shortcut API and automatically detects your workspace name.

### 3. Select a Project

Back in Quackback:

1. Choose the Shortcut project where stories should be created
2. Stories will be created in this project when new feedback is submitted

### 4. Configure Status Mappings

Map Shortcut workflow states to Quackback statuses:

1. Go to the Shortcut integration settings
2. Configure status mappings between Shortcut workflow state names and Quackback statuses
3. Each Shortcut workflow state can be mapped to a corresponding Quackback status, or set to ignore

Shortcut uses workflow state IDs internally. Quackback maintains a mapping of workflow state IDs to their names, so status sync resolves the ID to a name before looking up the configured mapping.

### 5. Configure Events

Choose which events trigger Shortcut actions:

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| New post | Create a Shortcut story with the feedback details |

<Note>
The Shortcut integration currently creates stories only for `post.created` events. Status changes and comments are handled through the status sync mechanism rather than creating new stories.
</Note>

### 6. Save and Test

1. Click **Save**
2. Submit test feedback to verify a story is created in Shortcut

## Story Format

When a new feedback post triggers story creation, the Shortcut story includes:

- **Name**: The feedback post title (truncated to 512 characters if needed)
- **Description** (Markdown): The post content, followed by metadata including the author, board, vote count, and a link back to the post in Quackback
- **Story type**: Feature
- **Project**: The selected Shortcut project

## Status Sync

When status sync is configured, Quackback receives webhook events from Shortcut. When a linked story's workflow state changes:

1. Shortcut sends a webhook event to Quackback
2. Quackback looks for story update actions with `workflow_state_id` changes
3. The new workflow state ID is resolved to a state name using the cached workflow states mapping
4. If a status mapping exists for that state name, the linked feedback post's status is updated

The webhook signature is verified using HMAC-SHA256 via the `Payload-Signature` header.

## Manage the integration

### Pause

Temporarily stop the integration:

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Shortcut**
2. Toggle **Enabled** off
3. Story creation and status sync pause, but the connection remains

### Reconnect

If you see connection errors:

1. Generate a new API token in Shortcut
2. Update the token in **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Shortcut**

### Disconnect

To fully remove the integration:

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Shortcut**
2. Click **Disconnect**
3. Confirm the action

## Troubleshooting

### Stories Not Being Created

1. **Check integration status** -- look for errors in settings
2. **Verify project selection** -- ensure a Shortcut project is selected
3. **Check event mappings** -- confirm `post.created` is mapped
4. **Validate API token** -- ensure the token has not been revoked in Shortcut

### Status Sync Not Working

1. **Check status mappings** -- ensure Shortcut workflow states are mapped to Quackback statuses
2. **Verify workflow states** -- the integration needs a mapping of workflow state IDs to names; if new states were added in Shortcut, they may need to be configured
3. **Check webhook** -- the Shortcut webhook may need to be re-registered

### "Authentication Failed" Error

Shortcut API tokens do not expire automatically but can be revoked. If you see this error:

1. Verify the token is still valid in Shortcut settings
2. Generate a new token if needed
3. Update the token in Quackback
