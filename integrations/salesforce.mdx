# Salesforce

Know who's asking. Automatically match feedback authors to Salesforce contacts and surface account names, opportunity stages, and deal values alongside their requests. Prioritize feedback from your most valuable customers.

## Overview

The Salesforce integration enables:

- **Account enrichment** -- see account name, opportunity stage, and deal value alongside feedback
- **Contact lookup** -- automatically match feedback authors to Salesforce contacts by email address
- **Case creation** -- create Salesforce cases from feedback posts for tracking in your CRM

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to your Quackback workspace
- A Salesforce account with API access
- A Salesforce Connected App (see [Create a Connected App](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_create.htm))

## Setup

### 1. Create a Salesforce Connected App

1. Go to **Setup > App Manager** in Salesforce
2. Click **New Connected App**
3. Enable OAuth Settings
4. Add these OAuth scopes:
   - `api` -- Access and manage your data
   - `refresh_token` -- Perform requests at any time
5. Set the **Callback URL** to your Quackback OAuth callback URL
6. Save and copy the **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret**

<Note>
It may take up to 10 minutes for a new Connected App to become active in Salesforce.
</Note>

### 2. Configure Platform Credentials

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Salesforce**
2. Enter the following credentials:
   - **Consumer Key** from your Connected App
   - **Consumer Secret** from your Connected App

### 3. Connect Your Account

1. Click **Connect to Salesforce**
2. You'll be redirected to Salesforce to authorize the application
3. Log in and click **Allow**

### 4. Save and Test

1. Click **Save**
2. Submit test feedback with an email address that matches a Salesforce contact
3. The feedback post will be enriched with the contact's account data

## How Enrichment Works

When new feedback is submitted, Quackback:

1. Queries Salesforce for a Contact matching the author's email
2. If found, retrieves the Contact's Account name and details
3. Links the feedback post to the Salesforce contact with a direct link to the Lightning contact view

This helps your team see the revenue impact of feature requests and prioritize feedback from key accounts.

## Manage the Integration

### Pause

Temporarily stop enrichment:

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Salesforce**
2. Toggle **Enabled** off
3. Enrichment pauses, but the connection remains

### Reconnect

If you see connection errors:

1. Click **Reconnect**
2. Re-authorize in Salesforce
3. Tokens are automatically refreshed when they expire

### Disconnect

To fully remove the integration:

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Salesforce**
2. Click **Disconnect**
3. Confirm the action

## Troubleshooting

### Contacts Not Being Matched

1. **Check email addresses** -- the feedback author's email must exactly match a Salesforce Contact's email field
2. **Verify permissions** -- the connected account needs read access to Contacts and Accounts
3. **Check integration status** -- look for errors in settings

### "Authentication Failed" Error

Salesforce OAuth tokens expire and are automatically refreshed. If refresh fails:

1. Click **Reconnect**
2. Re-authorize the app in Salesforce

### Connected App Not Working

1. Verify the Connected App is active (can take up to 10 minutes after creation)
2. Check that the OAuth scopes include `api` and `refresh_token`
3. Confirm the callback URL matches your Quackback instance
