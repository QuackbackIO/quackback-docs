# HubSpot

See the revenue behind every feature request. Connect HubSpot to enrich feedback posts with contact data, company information, lifecycle stage, and deal pipeline value -- so you can prioritize what matters most to your bottom line.

## Overview

The HubSpot integration provides:

- **Customer context** -- enrich feedback with HubSpot contact data like company, deal value, and lifecycle stage
- **Revenue insights** -- see the revenue impact of feature requests by linking feedback to deal pipeline data

<Note>
HubSpot is an enrichment integration. It does not send notifications or create records in HubSpot -- it pulls contact and deal data into Quackback to give you context on who is requesting what.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to your Quackback workspace
- A HubSpot account with API access
- A HubSpot OAuth application (created in the [HubSpot Developer Portal](https://developers.hubspot.com/))

## Setup

### 1. Create a HubSpot OAuth Application

1. Go to the [HubSpot Developer Portal](https://developers.hubspot.com/)
2. Create a new app or use an existing one
3. Under the **Auth** tab, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
4. Add your Quackback OAuth callback URL as a redirect URI

### 2. Configure Platform Credentials

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > HubSpot**
2. Enter the following credentials:
   - **Client ID** from your HubSpot application
   - **Client Secret** from your HubSpot application

### 3. Connect Your Account

1. Click **Connect to HubSpot**
2. You'll be redirected to HubSpot to authorize the application
3. Select the HubSpot account you want to connect
4. Review the permissions and click **Grant access**

The app requests these OAuth scopes:

| Scope | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `crm.objects.contacts.read` | Look up contacts by email |
| `crm.objects.companies.read` | Read company information |
| `crm.objects.deals.read` | Read deal pipeline data and amounts |
| `oauth` | Token management |

### 4. Verify the Connection

Once connected, Quackback stores your HubSpot portal ID and domain. You can verify the connection is active in the integration settings.

## How It Works

### Contact Lookup

When you view a feedback post, Quackback can look up the author's email in HubSpot and display:

- **Name** -- first and last name from the contact record
- **Company** -- the associated company name
- **Lifecycle stage** -- where the contact is in your pipeline (subscriber, lead, customer, etc.)

### Deal Enrichment

Beyond basic contact data, the integration fetches associated deals (up to 5 per contact) and shows:

- **Deal name** and current **stage**
- **Deal amount** for each associated deal
- **Total deal value** -- the combined value across all associated deals

This lets you see at a glance whether a feature request comes from a prospect with a \$500 deal or an enterprise customer with \$500,000 in pipeline.

<Tip>
Use deal value data to prioritize feature requests. Sort your feedback board by revenue impact to focus on what drives the most business value.
</Tip>

### Token Refresh

HubSpot access tokens expire after 30 minutes. Quackback automatically refreshes tokens using the stored refresh token when they expire, so the connection stays active without manual intervention.

## Manage the Integration

### Pause

Temporarily stop the integration:

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > HubSpot**
2. Toggle **Enabled** off
3. Contact lookups pause, but the connection remains

### Reconnect

If you see connection errors:

1. Click **Reconnect**
2. Re-authorize in HubSpot
3. Tokens are automatically refreshed when they expire

### Disconnect

To fully remove the integration:

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > HubSpot**
2. Click **Disconnect**
3. Confirm the action

<Note>
Disconnecting revokes the OAuth refresh token with HubSpot and removes the stored credentials from Quackback.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### Contact Not Found

1. **Check the email** -- the lookup matches on exact email address
2. **Verify the contact exists** -- confirm the contact is in your HubSpot CRM
3. **Check permissions** -- the connected HubSpot account must have access to the contact

### Deal Data Missing

1. **Check deal associations** -- the contact must be associated with deals in HubSpot
2. **Verify deal properties** -- deals need `dealname`, `dealstage`, and `amount` properties populated
3. **Limit** -- only the first 5 associated deals are fetched

### "Authentication Failed" Error

HubSpot tokens are short-lived (30 minutes) and auto-refresh. If refresh fails:

1. Click **Reconnect**
2. Re-authorize the app in HubSpot
3. If the issue persists, verify your Client ID and Client Secret are still valid in the HubSpot Developer Portal
