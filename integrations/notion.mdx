# Notion

Feedback in your workspace. Automatically create pages in a Notion database when feedback is submitted. Each page includes rich content with feedback details, author info, and direct links back to your portal.

## Overview

The Notion integration enables:

- **Create database items from feedback** -- automatically create a page in a Notion database when new feedback is submitted
- **Two-way status sync** -- keep feedback statuses in sync between Notion and Quackback
- **Rich content** -- feedback details, author info, and direct links are included in the Notion page

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to your Quackback workspace
- A Notion workspace with admin access
- A Notion integration (created at [Notion Developers](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration))

## Setup

### 1. Create a Notion Integration

1. Go to [Notion Developers](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration)
2. Create a new integration
3. Copy the **OAuth Client ID** and **OAuth Client Secret**

<Note>
You need a public integration with OAuth capabilities, not an internal integration. Internal integrations use API keys, which won't work with Quackback's OAuth flow.
</Note>

### 2. Configure Platform Credentials

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Notion**
2. Enter the following credentials:
   - **OAuth Client ID** from your Notion integration
   - **OAuth Client Secret** from your Notion integration

### 3. Connect Your Workspace

1. Click **Connect to Notion**
2. You'll be redirected to Notion to authorize the integration
3. Select which pages and databases to share with Quackback
4. Click **Allow access**

<Tip>
During authorization, Notion lets you choose exactly which pages and databases the integration can access. Select at least the database you want to use for feedback items.
</Tip>

### 4. Select a Database

Back in Quackback:

1. Choose the Notion database where pages should be created
2. Pages will be created in this database when new feedback is submitted

### 5. Configure Status Mappings

Map Notion status properties to Quackback statuses. Status sync works bidirectionally -- changes in either platform update the other.

### 6. Save and Test

1. Click **Save**
2. Submit test feedback to verify a page is created in your Notion database

## Page Format

When feedback triggers page creation, the Notion page includes:

- **Title**: The feedback post title
- **Content blocks**: The post content, author details, board name, vote count, and a link back to the post in Quackback

## Manage the Integration

### Pause

Temporarily stop the integration:

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Notion**
2. Toggle **Enabled** off
3. Page creation pauses, but the connection remains

### Reconnect

If you see connection errors:

1. Click **Reconnect**
2. Re-authorize in Notion
3. Reselect the pages and databases to share

### Disconnect

To fully remove the integration:

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Notion**
2. Click **Disconnect**
3. Confirm the action

## Troubleshooting

### Pages Not Being Created

1. **Check integration status** -- look for errors in settings
2. **Verify database selection** -- ensure a Notion database is selected
3. **Check access** -- the integration must have access to the selected database (granted during OAuth authorization)

### "Authentication Failed" Error

1. Click **Reconnect**
2. Re-authorize the integration in Notion

### Database Not Appearing

The database must be shared with the integration during the OAuth authorization step. Reconnect and select the database when prompted.
