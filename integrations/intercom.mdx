# Intercom

Know your customers behind every request. Connect Intercom to enrich feedback posts with contact data, company information, custom attributes, and tags -- so you can understand who is asking for what and why.

## Overview

The Intercom integration provides:

- **Capture feedback** -- turn Intercom conversations into feedback posts without leaving your inbox
- **Customer context** -- enrich feedback with Intercom contact data like plan, company, and conversation history

<Note>
Intercom is an enrichment integration. It pulls contact data into Quackback to give you context on the customers behind your feedback. It does not send notifications to Intercom.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to your Quackback workspace
- An Intercom workspace with admin access
- An Intercom OAuth application (created in the [Intercom Developer Hub](https://developers.intercom.com/))

## Setup

### 1. Create an Intercom OAuth Application

1. Go to the [Intercom Developer Hub](https://developers.intercom.com/)
2. Create a new app
3. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
4. Add your Quackback OAuth callback URL as a redirect URI

### 2. Configure Platform Credentials

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Intercom**
2. Enter the following credentials:
   - **Client ID** from your Intercom application
   - **Client Secret** from your Intercom application

### 3. Connect Your Workspace

1. Click **Connect to Intercom**
2. You'll be redirected to Intercom to authorize the application
3. Review the permissions and click **Authorize**

After authorization, Quackback stores your Intercom app ID and workspace name.

### 4. Verify the Connection

Once connected, verify the integration shows as active in **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Intercom**.

## How It Works

### Contact Lookup

When you view a feedback post, Quackback can look up the author's email in Intercom and display:

- **Name** -- the contact's full name
- **Email** -- the contact's email address
- **Company** -- the associated company name and ID
- **Custom attributes** -- any custom data fields you have on the contact (e.g., plan name, account tier, MRR)
- **Tags** -- all tags applied to the contact in Intercom

<Tip>
Custom attributes are especially useful if you store plan or revenue data on your Intercom contacts. This data appears alongside feedback posts to help you prioritize by customer segment.
</Tip>

### No Token Expiration

Unlike some OAuth providers, Intercom access tokens do not expire. Once connected, the integration stays active without requiring token refreshes.

## Manage the Integration

### Pause

Temporarily stop the integration:

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Intercom**
2. Toggle **Enabled** off
3. Contact lookups pause, but the connection remains

### Reconnect

If you see connection errors:

1. Click **Reconnect**
2. Re-authorize in Intercom

### Disconnect

To fully remove the integration:

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Intercom**
2. Click **Disconnect**
3. Confirm the action

<Note>
Intercom does not support programmatic token revocation. Disconnecting removes the stored credentials from Quackback, but you may also want to revoke access from the Intercom Developer Hub.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### Contact Not Found

1. **Check the email** -- the lookup matches on exact email address
2. **Verify the contact exists** -- confirm the contact is in your Intercom workspace
3. **Check contact type** -- both leads and users are searchable

### Custom Attributes Missing

1. **Verify the attribute exists** -- check that the custom attribute is defined in Intercom
2. **Check the contact record** -- the attribute must have a value set on the specific contact

### "Authentication Failed" Error

1. Verify your Client ID and Client Secret are correct
2. Click **Reconnect** and re-authorize the app
3. Check that the app has not been revoked in the Intercom Developer Hub
