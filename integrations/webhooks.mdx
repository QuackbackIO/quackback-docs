# Send events with webhooks

Build any integration you need. Webhooks send real-time HTTP notifications to any endpoint when events occur in Quackback. Connect to Zapier, your data warehouse, custom bots, or internal tools.

## Overview

Webhooks are managed entirely through the [REST API](/api/overview). Each webhook specifies:

- A **URL** to receive POST requests
- Which **events** to listen for
- Optional **board filtering** to scope events to specific boards
- A **signing secret** for verifying authenticity (HMAC-SHA256)

## Create a webhook

**[Your App]** Create a webhook via the API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://feedback.example.com/api/v1/webhooks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer qb_your_admin_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://your-server.com/webhook",
    "events": ["post.created", "post.status_changed"],
    "boardIds": ["board_01h455vb4pex5vsknk084sn02q"]
  }'
```

The response includes the signing secret, which is only shown once:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "webhook_01h455vb4pex5vsknk084sn02q",
    "url": "https://your-server.com/webhook",
    "secret": "whsec_...",
    "events": ["post.created", "post.status_changed"],
    "boardIds": ["board_01h455vb4pex5vsknk084sn02q"],
    "status": "active",
    "createdAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

<Warning>
Store the `secret` immediately. It cannot be retrieved again. If you lose it, use the rotate endpoint to generate a new one.
</Warning>

## Event Types

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `post.created` | New feedback post submitted |
| `post.status_changed` | Post status updated |
| `post.vote_threshold` | Post reached a vote threshold |
| `comment.created` | New comment added to a post |

## Request Headers

Each webhook delivery includes these headers:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` |
| `X-Quackback-Event` | Event type (e.g., `post.created`) |
| `X-Quackback-Signature` | HMAC-SHA256 signature for verification |
| `X-Quackback-Timestamp` | Unix timestamp of the request |

## Signature Verification

**[Your Server]** Every webhook delivery is signed with HMAC-SHA256. Always verify the signature to confirm the request came from Quackback.

The signature is computed over `{timestamp}.{json_body}`:

```javascript
import crypto from 'crypto';

function verifyWebhook(payload, signature, timestamp, secret) {
  const signaturePayload = `${timestamp}.${payload}`;
  const expected = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(signaturePayload)
    .digest('hex');

  return `sha256=${expected}` === signature;
}

// In your handler
app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  const signature = req.headers['x-quackback-signature'];
  const timestamp = req.headers['x-quackback-timestamp'];
  const payload = JSON.stringify(req.body);

  if (!verifyWebhook(payload, signature, timestamp, WEBHOOK_SECRET)) {
    return res.status(401).send('Invalid signature');
  }

  // Process the event
  console.log('Event:', req.body.event);
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```

<Tip>
Also check that the timestamp is recent (within 5 minutes) to prevent replay attacks.
</Tip>

## Board Filtering

Pass `boardIds` when creating a webhook to only receive events from specific boards. If omitted, the webhook receives events from all boards.

```bash
# Only events from a specific board
curl -X POST https://feedback.example.com/api/v1/webhooks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer qb_your_admin_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://your-server.com/webhook",
    "events": ["post.created"],
    "boardIds": ["board_01h455vb4pex5vsknk084sn02q"]
  }'
```

## Manage webhooks

### List webhooks

```bash
curl https://feedback.example.com/api/v1/webhooks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer qb_your_admin_key"
```

### Update a webhook

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://feedback.example.com/api/v1/webhooks/webhook_01h4... \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer qb_your_admin_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "events": ["post.created", "comment.created"] }'
```

### Rotate the signing secret

If a secret is compromised, rotate it:

```bash
curl -X POST https://feedback.example.com/api/v1/webhooks/webhook_01h4.../rotate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer qb_your_admin_key"
```

The response contains the new secret. Update your server immediately.

### Delete a webhook

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://feedback.example.com/api/v1/webhooks/webhook_01h4... \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer qb_your_admin_key"
```

## Use Cases

### Custom Slack Bot

Build a Slack bot with more control than the built-in integration:

```javascript
app.post('/webhook', async (req, res) => {
  const { event, data } = req.body;

  if (event === 'post.created') {
    await slack.chat.postMessage({
      channel: '#feedback',
      text: `New feedback: ${data.post.title}`,
    });
  }

  res.sendStatus(200);
});
```

### Zapier / n8n Integration

1. **[Zapier / n8n]** Create a Zap or n8n workflow with a webhook trigger
2. Copy the webhook URL
3. **[Your App]** Create a Quackback webhook pointing to that URL
4. **[Zapier / n8n]** Map fields in your automation tool

### Data Warehouse Sync

Log events to your analytics platform:

```javascript
app.post('/webhook', async (req, res) => {
  const { event, timestamp, data } = req.body;

  await db.insert('feedback_events', {
    event_type: event,
    event_time: timestamp,
    post_id: data.post?.id,
    raw_payload: JSON.stringify(data),
  });

  res.sendStatus(200);
});
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Always verify signatures** - reject unverified requests
2. **Use HTTPS** - never use HTTP endpoints for webhook receivers
3. **Check timestamps** - reject requests older than 5 minutes
4. **Rotate secrets periodically** - use the rotate endpoint
5. **Respond quickly** - return a `200` status within a few seconds; process asynchronously if needed
