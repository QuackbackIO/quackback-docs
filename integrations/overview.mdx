# Integrations Overview

Connect Quackback to your existing tools to streamline your feedback workflow.

## Available Integrations

| Integration | Status | Description |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| [Slack](/integrations/slack) | Available | Post notifications to Slack channels |
| [Webhooks](/integrations/webhooks) | Planned | Send events to any HTTP endpoint |
| [Discord](/integrations/discord) | Planned | Post notifications to Discord |
| [Linear](/integrations/linear) | Planned | Sync feedback with Linear issues |
| Jira | Planned | Sync feedback with Jira issues |

## How Integrations Work

Quackback uses an **event-driven** integration system:

```
Event Occurs → Event Dispatched → Integration Triggered → Notification Sent
```

### Events

Integrations can respond to these events:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `post.created` | New feedback post submitted |
| `post.status_changed` | Post status updated (e.g., Planned → Shipped) |
| `comment.created` | New comment on a post |

### Event Mappings

Configure which events trigger which integrations:

1. Go to **Admin → Settings → Integrations**
2. Select an integration
3. Configure **Event Mappings**
4. Choose which events to send

For example, only send to Slack when a post becomes "Planned".

## Setting Up Integrations

### General Flow

1. Navigate to **Admin → Settings → Integrations**
2. Click on the integration you want to set up
3. Follow the connection flow (usually OAuth)
4. Configure notification settings
5. Test the connection
6. Enable the integration

### Permissions Required

<Note>
Only **Admins** can configure integrations.
</Note>

## Integration Status

Each integration shows its current status:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Connected** | Working normally |
| **Paused** | Temporarily disabled |
| **Error** | Connection issue, needs attention |
| **Not Connected** | Not yet set up |

### Pausing Integrations

Temporarily disable an integration without disconnecting:

1. Go to the integration settings
2. Toggle **Enabled** off
3. The integration pauses but credentials are preserved

### Reconnecting

If an integration shows errors:

1. Check the error message
2. Re-authenticate if tokens expired
3. Verify the connected service is working
4. Contact support if issues persist

## Security

### OAuth Tokens

Integration OAuth tokens are:
- Encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM with workspace-specific keys
- Scoped to minimum required permissions
- Revocable from both Quackback and the connected service

## Best Practices

### Start Simple

<Tip>
Begin with one integration. Add more as your workflow matures.
</Tip>

### Map Relevant Events

Don't send every event to every channel. Be selective:
- New feedback → general notification
- Status changes → specific channels
- Comments → maybe skip or use digest

### Monitor for Errors

Regularly check integration status. Failed notifications can mean:
- Expired tokens
- Removed channels
- Service outages

### Document for Your Team

Let your team know:
- Which integrations are active
- What events trigger notifications
- Where to find feedback notifications

## Enterprise Features

Enterprise customers get additional capabilities:

- **Audit logging** for integration changes
- **SSO-scoped integrations** for security
- **Priority support** for integration issues

## Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Sending

1. Check integration status for errors
2. Verify event mappings are configured
3. Check the target channel/endpoint exists
4. Review recent activity logs

### Duplicate Notifications

1. Check for multiple event mappings
2. Verify you don't have duplicate integrations
3. Review webhook retry settings

### Connection Lost

1. Tokens may have expired
2. Re-authenticate the integration
3. Check the third-party service status

## Next Steps

- [Slack](/integrations/slack) - Set up Slack notifications
- [Webhooks](/integrations/webhooks) - Build custom integrations (planned)
- [Discord](/integrations/discord) - Discord notifications (planned)
