# Make

Automate your feedback workflow. Connect Quackback to Make (formerly Integromat) to trigger visual automation scenarios when feedback is submitted, statuses change, or comments are added. Route feedback data to 1,500+ apps without writing code.

## Overview

The Make integration enables:

- **Trigger scenarios** -- trigger Make scenarios when feedback is submitted, statuses change, or comments are added
- **Visual automation** -- build visual automation flows connecting feedback to 1,500+ apps in Make

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to your Quackback workspace
- A [Make](https://www.make.com) account

## Setup

### 1. Create a Webhook in Make

1. Log in to Make and create a new scenario
2. Add a **Webhooks > Custom webhook** module as the trigger
3. Click **Add** to create a new webhook
4. Copy the **webhook URL** (it will look like `https://hook.make.com/...`)

### 2. Connect in Quackback

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Make**
2. Click **Connect**
3. Paste the Make webhook URL
4. Click **Save**

### 3. Configure Events

Choose which events trigger your Make scenario:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| New post | Someone submits new feedback |
| Status change | Post status is updated |
| New comment | Comment added to a post |

### 4. Test the Connection

1. Go back to Make and click **Run once** on your scenario
2. Submit test feedback in Quackback
3. Make should receive the webhook payload and display the data structure
4. Use this to configure the rest of your scenario

## Payload Format

Quackback sends a JSON payload to your Make webhook. The payload includes event details, post data, author information, and board context. Use Make's data mapping to route fields to downstream modules.

## Example Scenarios

### Send Feedback to Google Sheets

1. **Trigger**: Quackback webhook (new post)
2. **Action**: Google Sheets > Add a Row
3. Map fields: title, description, author email, board name

### Create Jira Tickets from High-Priority Feedback

1. **Trigger**: Quackback webhook (new post)
2. **Filter**: Check if board equals "Bug Reports"
3. **Action**: Jira > Create an Issue

### Notify a Slack Channel for Status Changes

1. **Trigger**: Quackback webhook (status change)
2. **Action**: Slack > Send a Message
3. Map fields: post title, old status, new status

## Manage the Integration

### Pause

Temporarily stop sending events:

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Make**
2. Toggle **Enabled** off
3. Events stop, but the webhook URL is preserved

### Disconnect

To fully remove the integration:

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Make**
2. Click **Disconnect**
3. Confirm the action

<Note>
Disconnecting in Quackback does not delete the webhook in Make. You can clean it up in your Make scenario settings.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### Events Not Arriving in Make

1. **Check integration status** -- look for errors in Quackback settings
2. **Verify webhook URL** -- ensure the URL is a valid `make.com` or `integromat.com` address
3. **Check Make scenario** -- ensure the scenario is active (not paused)
4. **Review Make execution history** -- check for errors in the scenario log

### Invalid Webhook URL

The webhook URL must be an HTTPS URL on a `make.com` or `integromat.com` domain. Custom domains are not supported.
