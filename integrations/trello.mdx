# Trello

Feedback on your board. Automatically create Trello cards when feedback is submitted, and keep statuses synchronized -- when cards move between lists in Trello, the linked feedback post updates too.

## Overview

The Trello integration enables:

- **Create cards from feedback** -- automatically create a Trello card when new feedback is submitted
- **Two-way status sync** -- moving cards between lists in Trello updates the feedback status in Quackback
- **Rich descriptions** -- cards include feedback details, author info, and direct links back to your portal

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to your Quackback workspace
- A Trello account
- A Trello Power-Up (created at [Trello Power-Ups Admin](https://trello.com/power-ups/admin))

## Setup

### 1. Create a Trello Power-Up

1. Go to the [Trello Power-Ups Admin](https://trello.com/power-ups/admin)
2. Create a new Power-Up
3. Copy the **API Key** and **API Secret**

### 2. Configure Platform Credentials

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Trello**
2. Enter the following credentials:
   - **API Key** from your Trello Power-Up
   - **API Secret** from your Trello Power-Up

### 3. Connect Your Account

1. Click **Connect to Trello**
2. You'll be redirected to Trello to authorize the application
3. The app requests `read` and `write` permissions with no expiration
4. Click **Allow**

### 4. Select a Board and List

Back in Quackback:

1. Choose the Trello board where cards should be created
2. Select the list within the board (e.g., "Incoming" or "To Do")
3. New cards appear at the top of the selected list

### 5. Configure Status Mappings

Map Trello lists to Quackback statuses. When a card moves to a different list, the linked feedback post's status updates to match.

### 6. Save and Test

1. Click **Save**
2. Submit test feedback to verify a card is created in Trello

## Card Format

When feedback triggers card creation, the Trello card includes:

- **Name**: The feedback post title
- **Description**: The post content, author details, board name, vote count, and a link back to the post in Quackback

Cards are created at the top of the selected list.

## Status Sync

Quackback registers a webhook with Trello to receive card updates. When a linked card moves between lists:

1. Trello sends a webhook to Quackback
2. The webhook signature is verified using HMAC-SHA1
3. The destination list name is mapped to a Quackback status
4. The linked feedback post's status is updated

<Note>
Status sync responds to `updateCard` actions where a card moves between lists. Other card changes (description edits, label updates) are ignored.
</Note>

## Manage the Integration

### Pause

Temporarily stop the integration:

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Trello**
2. Toggle **Enabled** off
3. Card creation and status sync pause, but the connection remains

### Reconnect

If you see connection errors:

1. Click **Reconnect**
2. Re-authorize in Trello

### Disconnect

To fully remove the integration:

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Trello**
2. Click **Disconnect**
3. Confirm the action

## Troubleshooting

### Cards Not Being Created

1. **Check integration status** -- look for errors in settings
2. **Verify board and list selection** -- ensure both are selected
3. **Check permissions** -- the connected account needs write access to the board

### Status Sync Not Working

1. **Check status mappings** -- ensure Trello lists are mapped to Quackback statuses
2. **Verify webhook** -- the Trello webhook may need to be re-registered
3. **Check board access** -- the connected account needs access to the board

### "Authentication Failed" Error

1. Click **Reconnect**
2. Re-authorize the app in Trello
