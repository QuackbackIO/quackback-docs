# Discord Integration

Send feedback notifications directly to your Discord server.

<Warning>
**Status: Coming Soon**

The Discord integration is planned but not yet implemented. This page outlines the planned functionality.
</Warning>

## Planned Features

### Notifications

Send notifications to Discord channels when:

- New feedback is submitted
- Post status changes
- New comments are posted

### Rich Embeds

Discord notifications will use rich embeds with:

- Color-coded status indicators
- Clickable links to posts
- Author information
- Timestamp

### Channel Configuration

Configure which events go to which channels:

- Route new posts to a general feedback channel
- Send status updates to a product channel
- Filter by board or status

## Planned Setup Flow

1. Navigate to **Admin > Settings > Integrations**
2. Click **Discord**
3. Click **Add to Server**
4. Select your Discord server
5. Authorize the bot permissions
6. Choose a default channel
7. Configure event mappings

## Webhook Support

For simpler setups, webhook-based Discord notifications may be supported:

1. Create a webhook in your Discord channel settings
2. Add the webhook URL in Quackback
3. Configure which events trigger notifications

## Feature Request

<Tip>
Want Discord integration sooner? Let us know:

- Vote for the feature on our [roadmap](https://github.com/quackback/quackback/discussions)
- Share your use case in the discussions
- Contribute to the implementation
</Tip>

## Technical Notes

The Discord integration will follow the same hook architecture as existing integrations:

- Event-driven notifications via the hook system
- OAuth2 for bot authorization (or webhooks for simpler setup)
- Encrypted token storage
- Configurable event mappings per channel

## Alternative: Webhooks

While waiting for native Discord support, you can use Discord webhooks with Quackback's webhook integration:

1. Create a Discord webhook in your channel
2. Set up a middleware service to transform Quackback events to Discord format
3. Configure Quackback to send to your middleware

See [Webhooks](/integrations/webhooks) for more information.

## Next Steps

- [Slack](/integrations/slack) - Currently available integration
- [Webhooks](/integrations/webhooks) - Build custom integrations
- [Integrations Overview](/integrations/overview) - All integrations
