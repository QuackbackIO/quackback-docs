# Discord

Feedback where your community lives. Get notified in Discord channels when new feedback arrives, statuses change, or users comment. Messages use rich embeds with post details and direct links back to your portal.

## Overview

The Discord integration sends notifications to channels when:
- New feedback is submitted
- Post status changes
- New comments are posted

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to your Quackback workspace
- A Discord application with a bot user (created at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
- Permission to add bots to your Discord server

## Setup

### 1. Create a Discord Application

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click **New Application** and give it a name
3. Go to the **Bot** tab and create a bot user
4. Copy the **Bot Token**

### 2. Configure Platform Credentials

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Discord**
2. Enter the following credentials:
   - **Client ID** from your Discord application's General Information page
   - **Client Secret** from your Discord application's General Information page
   - **Bot Token** from your Discord application's Bot page

### 3. Connect Your Server

1. Click **Connect to Discord**
2. You'll be redirected to Discord to authorize the bot
3. Select the server you want to add the bot to
4. Click **Authorize**

The bot requests these permissions:
- **Send Messages** (2048) -- post notifications to channels
- **Embed Links** (16384) -- format messages with rich embeds

### 4. Select a Channel

Back in Quackback:

1. Choose a channel for notifications
2. Select from text channels available in the connected server

### 5. Configure Events

Choose which events trigger Discord notifications:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| New post | Someone submits new feedback |
| Status change | Post status is updated |
| New comment | Comment added to a post |

### 6. Save and Test

1. Click **Save**
2. Click **Send Test** to verify the connection
3. Check your Discord channel for the test message

## Notification Format

Discord notifications use rich embeds with color-coded status indicators.

**New post:**
```
[Embed]
Author: New feedback from jane@example.com
Title: Add dark mode support (linked to post)
Description: It would be great to have a dark mode...
Footer: Board: feature-requests
Color: Blue (#5865F2)
```

**Status change:**
```
[Embed]
Author: Status changed by admin@example.com
Title: Add dark mode support (linked to post)
Description: Under Review > **Planned**
Color: Status-dependent (green for Complete, yellow for In Progress, etc.)
```

**New comment:**
```
[Embed]
Author: New comment from jane@example.com
Title: Add dark mode support (linked to post)
Description: Great idea! We're considering this for Q2.
Color: Blue (#5865F2)
```

All notifications include clickable links to the post.

## Event Mapping

Send different events to different channels:

1. Go to the Discord integration settings
2. Click **Add Event Mapping**
3. Configure:
   - **Event type**: post.created, post.status_changed, etc.
   - **Channel**: Target Discord channel
   - **Filters** (optional): Board, status, or other conditions

## Manage the integration

### Pause Notifications

Temporarily stop notifications:

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Discord**
2. Toggle **Enabled** off
3. Notifications pause, but the connection remains

### Reconnect

If you see connection errors:

1. Click **Reconnect**
2. Re-authorize in Discord
3. Reconfigure channels if needed

### Disconnect

To fully remove the integration:

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Discord**
2. Click **Disconnect**
3. Confirm the action

## Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Appearing

1. **Check integration status** -- look for errors in settings
2. **Verify channel** -- ensure the channel still exists and the bot has access
3. **Check event mappings** -- confirm events are configured
4. **Bot permissions** -- verify the bot has Send Messages and Embed Links permissions in the channel

### "Authentication Failed" Error

The bot token may be invalid or the bot was removed from the server:

1. Check the bot token in your Discord Developer Portal
2. Re-authorize the bot in your server
3. Reconnect in Quackback
