# Discord Integration

<Note>
**Status: Community Contribution Welcome**

The Discord integration is not yet built. If you'd like to contribute, the architecture is ready - Quackback's event system makes adding new notification targets straightforward.
</Note>

## Workaround: Use Webhooks

You can get Discord notifications today using Quackback's [webhook integration](/integrations/webhooks) with Discord's incoming webhooks:

1. **Create a Discord webhook** - In your Discord channel settings, go to Integrations > Webhooks > New Webhook
2. **Create a Quackback webhook** - Point it at a small middleware service that reformats the payload
3. **Transform the payload** - Discord expects a specific embed format

### Example Middleware

```javascript
app.post('/quackback-to-discord', async (req, res) => {
  const { event, data } = req.body;

  if (event === 'post.created') {
    await fetch(DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        embeds: [{
          title: data.post.title,
          description: data.post.content?.substring(0, 200),
          color: 0x5865F2,
          url: `https://feedback.example.com/b/${data.post.boardSlug}/${data.post.id}`,
        }],
      }),
    });
  }

  res.sendStatus(200);
});
```
