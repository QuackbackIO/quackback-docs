# Zapier

Automate your feedback workflow. Connect Quackback to 6,000+ apps through Zapier, triggering Zaps when new feedback arrives, statuses change, or users comment. Push feedback data to spreadsheets, CRMs, project management tools, and more.

## Overview

The Zapier integration triggers webhooks when:
- New feedback is submitted
- Post status changes
- New comments are posted

Unlike other integrations, Zapier uses webhook URLs instead of OAuth. You create a Zap in Zapier, copy the webhook URL, and paste it into Quackback.

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to your Quackback workspace
- A [Zapier](https://zapier.com) account (free or paid)

## Setup

### 1. Create a Zap in Zapier

1. Log in to [Zapier](https://zapier.com)
2. Click **Create Zap**
3. For the trigger, choose **Webhooks by Zapier**
4. Select **Catch Hook** as the trigger event
5. Zapier provides a webhook URL (starting with `https://hooks.zapier.com/...`)
6. Copy this URL

### 2. Connect in Quackback

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Zapier**
2. Paste the webhook URL from Zapier
3. Click **Save**

Quackback sends a test ping to the webhook URL to verify it is reachable. If the test fails, check that the URL is correct and that the Zap is active.

### 3. Configure Your Zap

Back in Zapier:

1. Click **Test trigger** to receive the test event from Quackback
2. Add an action step (e.g., create a Google Sheets row, send an email, create a Jira ticket)
3. Map the fields from the Quackback payload to your action
4. Turn on the Zap

## Webhook Payload

Quackback sends a structured JSON payload to the Zapier webhook. The payload format depends on the event type.

**All payloads include:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `event` | Event type (`post.created`, `post.status_changed`, `comment.created`) |
| `timestamp` | ISO 8601 timestamp |
| `portal_url` | Your Quackback portal URL |
| `post` | Post details (always present) |

### post.created

```json
{
  "event": "post.created",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "portal_url": "https://feedback.example.com",
  "post": {
    "id": "post_abc123",
    "title": "Add dark mode support",
    "content": "It would be great to have a dark mode...",
    "board": "feature-requests",
    "url": "https://feedback.example.com/b/feature-requests/posts/post_abc123",
    "author_name": "Jane Smith",
    "author_email": "jane@example.com",
    "vote_count": 1
  }
}
```

### post.status\_changed

```json
{
  "event": "post.status_changed",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "portal_url": "https://feedback.example.com",
  "post": {
    "id": "post_abc123",
    "title": "Add dark mode support",
    "board": "feature-requests",
    "url": "https://feedback.example.com/b/feature-requests/posts/post_abc123"
  },
  "status_change": {
    "previous": "Under Review",
    "new": "Planned"
  }
}
```

### comment.created

```json
{
  "event": "comment.created",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "portal_url": "https://feedback.example.com",
  "post": {
    "id": "post_abc123",
    "title": "Add dark mode support",
    "board": "feature-requests",
    "url": "https://feedback.example.com/b/feature-requests/posts/post_abc123"
  },
  "comment": {
    "id": "comment_xyz789",
    "content": "Great idea! We are considering this for Q2.",
    "author_name": "Admin",
    "author_email": "admin@example.com"
  }
}
```

## Example Zaps

### New feedback to Google Sheets

1. **Trigger**: Webhooks by Zapier > Catch Hook
2. **Action**: Google Sheets > Create Spreadsheet Row
3. Map: title, content, author\_email, board, url

### Status change to Slack message

1. **Trigger**: Webhooks by Zapier > Catch Hook
2. **Filter**: Only continue if `event` equals `post.status_changed`
3. **Action**: Slack > Send Channel Message

### New post to Jira issue

1. **Trigger**: Webhooks by Zapier > Catch Hook
2. **Filter**: Only continue if `event` equals `post.created`
3. **Action**: Jira > Create Issue
4. Map: title to Summary, content to Description

## Manage the integration

### Update Webhook URL

If you need to point to a different Zap:

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Zapier**
2. Enter the new webhook URL
3. Click **Save**

### Disconnect

To remove the Zapier integration:

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Zapier**
2. Click **Disconnect**
3. Confirm the action

<Note>
Disconnecting removes the webhook URL from Quackback. You should also disable or delete the Zap in Zapier to prevent failed webhook deliveries.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### Zap Not Triggering

1. **Check Zap status** -- ensure the Zap is turned on in Zapier
2. **Verify webhook URL** -- confirm the URL starts with `https://hooks.zapier.com/`
3. **Check integration status** -- look for errors in Quackback settings
4. **Test the connection** -- resave the webhook URL to send a new test ping

### "Zap is No Longer Active" Error

The Zap may have been paused or deleted in Zapier:

1. Log in to Zapier and check the Zap status
2. Re-enable the Zap or create a new one
3. Update the webhook URL in Quackback if needed

### Webhook Delivery Failures

If webhook deliveries fail with 5xx errors or timeouts, Quackback automatically retries the delivery. If failures persist, check the Zap's webhook configuration in Zapier.

## Security

Quackback only sends webhooks to `hooks.zapier.com` URLs. Webhook URLs pointing to any other domain are rejected to prevent data exfiltration.
