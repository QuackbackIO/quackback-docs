# GitLab

Turn feedback into tracked issues. Automatically create GitLab issues when feedback arrives, and keep statuses synchronized -- when an issue is closed or reopened in GitLab, the linked feedback post updates too.

## Overview

The GitLab integration enables:

- **Create issues from feedback** -- automatically create a GitLab issue when new feedback is submitted
- **Two-way status sync** -- closing or reopening issues in GitLab updates the feedback status in Quackback via webhooks
- **Rich descriptions** -- issues include feedback details, author info, and direct links back to your portal

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to your Quackback workspace
- A GitLab account with access to the target project
- A GitLab OAuth application (created at [User Settings > Applications](https://gitlab.com/-/user_settings/applications))

## Setup

### 1. Create a GitLab OAuth Application

1. Go to [GitLab User Settings > Applications](https://gitlab.com/-/user_settings/applications)
2. Create a new application
3. Set the **Redirect URI** to your Quackback callback URL
4. Select the `api` scope
5. Copy the **Application ID** and **Secret**

### 2. Configure Platform Credentials

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > GitLab**
2. Enter the following credentials:
   - **Application ID** from your GitLab OAuth application
   - **Secret** from your GitLab OAuth application

### 3. Connect Your Account

1. Click **Connect to GitLab**
2. You'll be redirected to GitLab to authorize the application
3. Review the permissions and click **Authorize**

### 4. Select a Project

Back in Quackback:

1. Choose the GitLab project where issues should be created
2. Issues will be created in this project when new feedback is submitted

### 5. Configure Status Mappings

Map GitLab issue states to Quackback statuses:

| GitLab State | Default Mapping |
|--------------|-----------------|
| `opened` | Open |
| `closed` | Closed |

You can customize these mappings to match your workflow.

### 6. Save and Test

1. Click **Save**
2. Submit test feedback to verify an issue is created in GitLab

## Issue Format

When feedback triggers issue creation, the GitLab issue includes:

- **Title**: The feedback post title
- **Description**: The post content, author details, board name, vote count, and a link back to the post in Quackback

## Status Sync

Quackback registers a webhook with GitLab to receive issue updates. When a linked issue's state changes:

1. GitLab sends a webhook to Quackback
2. The webhook signature is verified via the `X-Gitlab-Token` header
3. If the issue state changed (opened, closed, or reopened), the linked feedback post's status is updated

<Note>
Status sync responds to issue `update`, `close`, and `reopen` actions. Other issue changes (label updates, assignments) are ignored.
</Note>

## Manage the Integration

### Pause

Temporarily stop the integration:

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > GitLab**
2. Toggle **Enabled** off
3. Issue creation and status sync pause, but the connection remains

### Reconnect

If you see connection errors:

1. Click **Reconnect**
2. Re-authorize in GitLab

### Disconnect

To fully remove the integration:

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > GitLab**
2. Click **Disconnect**
3. Confirm the action

## Troubleshooting

### Issues Not Being Created

1. **Check integration status** -- look for errors in settings
2. **Verify project selection** -- ensure a GitLab project is selected
3. **Check permissions** -- the connected account needs write access to the project

### Status Sync Not Working

1. **Check status mappings** -- ensure GitLab states are mapped to Quackback statuses
2. **Verify webhook** -- the GitLab webhook may need to be re-registered
3. **Check project permissions** -- the connected account needs admin access to manage webhooks

### "Authentication Failed" Error

1. Click **Reconnect**
2. Re-authorize the app in GitLab
