# Stripe

Prioritize by revenue. Automatically match feedback authors to Stripe customers and see MRR, plan tier, and subscription status alongside their requests. Know which feature requests come from your highest-value customers.

## Overview

The Stripe integration enables:

- **Revenue enrichment** -- see MRR, plan tier, and billing status alongside feedback to prioritize high-value customers
- **Customer lookup** -- automatically match feedback authors to Stripe customers by email address
- **Subscription context** -- view subscription status, plan name, and lifetime value for each feedback author

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to your Quackback workspace
- A Stripe account
- A Stripe API key with read access to customers

## Setup

### 1. Get Your Stripe API Key

1. Go to the [Stripe Dashboard > API Keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)
2. Copy your **Secret key** (starts with `sk_live_` or `sk_test_`)

<Tip>
Use a **restricted key** with read-only access to Customers for better security. Go to **API Keys > Create restricted key** and enable only "Customers: Read".
</Tip>

### 2. Connect to Stripe

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Stripe**
2. Click **Connect to Stripe**
3. Enter your **Stripe API key**
4. Click **Connect**

<Note>
Stripe uses API key authentication rather than OAuth. Your API key is encrypted at rest and only used to query the Stripe API.
</Note>

### 3. Save and Test

1. Click **Save**
2. Submit test feedback with an email address that matches a Stripe customer
3. The feedback post will be enriched with the customer's revenue data

## How Enrichment Works

When new feedback is submitted, Quackback:

1. Searches Stripe for a customer matching the author's email
2. If found, retrieves subscription and revenue data
3. Links the feedback post to the Stripe customer with a direct link to their dashboard profile

This helps your team prioritize feature requests from paying customers and understand the revenue impact of feedback.

## Manage the Integration

### Pause

Temporarily stop enrichment:

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Stripe**
2. Toggle **Enabled** off
3. Enrichment pauses, but the connection remains

### Reconnect

If you see connection errors:

1. Verify your API key is still valid in the Stripe Dashboard
2. Update the key in Quackback if needed

### Disconnect

To fully remove the integration:

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Stripe**
2. Click **Disconnect**
3. Confirm the action

## Troubleshooting

### Customers Not Being Matched

1. **Check email addresses** -- the feedback author's email must match a Stripe customer's email
2. **Verify API key** -- ensure the key has permission to read customers
3. **Check integration status** -- look for errors in settings

### "Authentication Failed" Error

Your API key may have been revoked or rotated:

1. Get a new API key from the Stripe Dashboard
2. Update the key in Quackback's integration settings

### Test vs. Live Mode

Stripe test keys (`sk_test_`) only match test customers. Use a live key (`sk_live_`) to match real customers.
