# Email Notifications

Quackback sends email notifications to keep users and admins informed. Voters are notified when their requested features ship. Admins get alerts when new feedback arrives. No third-party notification service required — configure SMTP or Resend and emails send automatically.

## Overview

Email notifications cover two audiences:

**For end users (voters and authors):**
- Status change notifications when a post they voted on or authored changes status
- Comment notifications when someone replies to their post
- Subscription updates for posts they're watching

**For admins and team members:**
- New feedback alerts when a post is submitted
- Daily or weekly digest of new feedback activity
- Mentions when tagged in a comment

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to your Quackback workspace
- An SMTP server or Resend API key

## Setup

### Option 1: SMTP (Recommended)

SMTP works with any email provider: Gmail, SendGrid, Postmark, Mailgun, Amazon SES, or your own mail server.

Set these environment variables:

```bash
EMAIL_SMTP_HOST="smtp.example.com"
EMAIL_SMTP_PORT="587"
EMAIL_SMTP_USER="your-username"
EMAIL_SMTP_PASS="your-password"
EMAIL_FROM="feedback@yourcompany.com"
```

Common provider settings:

| Provider | Host | Port |
|----------|------|------|
| SendGrid | `smtp.sendgrid.net` | 587 |
| Postmark | `smtp.postmarkapp.com` | 587 |
| Mailgun | `smtp.mailgun.org` | 587 |
| Amazon SES | `email-smtp.{region}.amazonaws.com` | 587 |
| Gmail | `smtp.gmail.com` | 587 |

### Option 2: Resend

[Resend](https://resend.com) provides a developer-focused email API. Set one environment variable:

```bash
EMAIL_RESEND_API_KEY="re_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
EMAIL_FROM="feedback@yourcompany.com"
```

<Note>
If neither SMTP nor Resend is configured, OTP codes are printed to the server console instead of emailed. All other email notifications are skipped.
</Note>

## How Notifications Work

### User Notifications

Users receive email when events occur on posts they're connected to:

| Event | Who gets notified |
|-------|-------------------|
| Status change (e.g., "Planned" → "Shipped") | All voters and the post author |
| New comment on a post | Post author and users watching the post |
| Admin reply to a post | Post author |

Users can unsubscribe from individual posts or all notifications from their account settings.

### Admin Notifications

Admins receive email for workspace-level events:

| Event | Who gets notified |
|-------|-------------------|
| New post submitted | Admins with new-post alerts enabled |
| Daily/weekly digest | Admins who opted into digest emails |
| @mention in a comment | The mentioned admin |

Configure admin notification preferences in **Admin → Settings → Notifications**.

### Authentication Emails

Quackback uses email for passwordless authentication:

- **OTP codes** — six-digit codes sent when a user signs in with email
- **Magic links** — one-click sign-in links (when enabled)

These are sent regardless of notification preferences.

## Configuration

### Sender Identity

The `EMAIL_FROM` address appears in the "From" field of all emails. Use a domain you own and have configured with SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records. This improves deliverability and prevents emails from landing in spam.

<Tip>
Use a subdomain like `feedback@mail.yourcompany.com` to separate feedback notifications from your primary email domain's reputation.
</Tip>

### Custom Branding

Emails automatically use your workspace branding:

- **Logo** — displayed in the email header
- **Workspace name** — used in email subjects and footers
- **Accent color** — applied to buttons and links

Configure branding in **Admin → Settings → Branding**.

### Digest Emails

Digest emails summarize feedback activity over a period:

1. Go to **Admin → Settings → Notifications**
2. Enable **Digest emails**
3. Choose frequency: **Daily** or **Weekly**
4. Select which boards to include

Digests include:
- New posts submitted since the last digest
- Top posts by vote count
- Status changes

## Testing

After configuring email, verify it works:

1. Go to **Admin → Settings → Email**
2. Click **Send Test Email**
3. Check your inbox for the test message

If the test email doesn't arrive:
- Check the server logs for SMTP errors
- Verify your SMTP credentials
- Ensure the `EMAIL_FROM` domain has valid DNS records

## Deliverability

To ensure emails reach inboxes:

1. **Set up SPF** — add your email provider to your domain's SPF record
2. **Enable DKIM** — sign outgoing emails with your domain's DKIM key
3. **Configure DMARC** — set a DMARC policy for your sending domain
4. **Use a dedicated sending domain** — avoid sharing reputation with marketing emails

## Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending

1. Check that `EMAIL_SMTP_HOST` or `EMAIL_RESEND_API_KEY` is set
2. Review server logs for connection errors
3. Verify the SMTP port is not blocked by your hosting provider

### Emails Going to Spam

1. Verify SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records for your sending domain
2. Avoid using free email providers (gmail.com, outlook.com) as the `EMAIL_FROM` address
3. Check your sender reputation with [mail-tester.com](https://www.mail-tester.com)

### Users Not Receiving Notifications

1. Check the user's notification preferences in their account settings
2. Verify they haven't unsubscribed from the post
3. Check the admin inbox for delivery errors
