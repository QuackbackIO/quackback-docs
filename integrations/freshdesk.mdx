# Freshdesk

See the support story behind every request. Automatically match feedback authors to Freshdesk contacts and surface their support history, open tickets, and satisfaction scores alongside their feedback.

## Overview

The Freshdesk integration enables:

- **Ticket enrichment** -- automatically match feedback authors to Freshdesk contacts and display their support history
- **Contact lookup** -- look up contacts by email to see open tickets, satisfaction scores, and account details

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to your Quackback workspace
- A Freshdesk account with API access
- Your Freshdesk subdomain and an API key

## Setup

### 1. Get Your Freshdesk API Key

1. Log in to your Freshdesk account
2. Click your profile icon in the top-right
3. Go to **Profile Settings**
4. Copy the **API Key** from the right sidebar

### 2. Connect to Freshdesk

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Freshdesk**
2. Click **Connect to Freshdesk**
3. Enter your **Freshdesk subdomain** (e.g., `yourcompany` from `yourcompany.freshdesk.com`)
4. Enter your **API key**
5. Click **Connect**

<Note>
Freshdesk uses API key authentication rather than OAuth. Your API key is encrypted at rest and only used to query the Freshdesk API.
</Note>

### 3. Save and Test

1. Click **Save**
2. Submit test feedback with an email address that matches a Freshdesk contact
3. The feedback post will be enriched with the contact's data

## How Enrichment Works

When new feedback is submitted, Quackback:

1. Looks up the author's email in Freshdesk via the Contacts API
2. If a match is found, links the feedback post to the Freshdesk contact
3. Displays the contact's support context alongside the feedback

This gives your team immediate visibility into whether a feedback author has open support tickets, their satisfaction history, and account details.

## Manage the Integration

### Pause

Temporarily stop enrichment:

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Freshdesk**
2. Toggle **Enabled** off
3. Enrichment pauses, but the connection remains

### Reconnect

If you see connection errors:

1. Verify your API key is still valid in Freshdesk
2. Update the credentials in Quackback if needed

### Disconnect

To fully remove the integration:

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > Integrations > Freshdesk**
2. Click **Disconnect**
3. Confirm the action

## Troubleshooting

### Contacts Not Being Matched

1. **Check email addresses** -- the feedback author's email must exactly match a Freshdesk contact
2. **Verify API key** -- ensure the key has permission to read contacts
3. **Check integration status** -- look for errors in settings

### "Authentication Failed" Error

Your API key may have been revoked or expired:

1. Generate a new API key in Freshdesk
2. Update the key in Quackback's integration settings
