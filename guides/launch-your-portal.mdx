# Launch your portal

Your workspace is configured. Now you need users to actually submit feedback. The gap between "portal is ready" and "users are contributing" is bigger than most teams expect. This lesson covers the launch checklist that turns a configured tool into a living feedback channel.

## Brand it first

An unbranded feedback portal feels like a random third-party tool. A branded one feels like part of your product. This difference matters more than you'd think - users are more likely to contribute when the portal feels official.

Take 5 minutes to set the basics:

- Upload your logo
- Set your brand color
- Match your product's visual tone

You don't need pixel-perfect design. You need "this is clearly from [your company]." See [Customize your portal](/admin/branding) for the settings.

## Place your links

Users can't submit feedback if they can't find the portal. Place links in the spots where users already go when they have thoughts about your product:

**High-value placements:**
- **In-app menu or sidebar.** A "Feedback" or "Feature Requests" link where users already navigate. This is your highest-traffic source.
- **Help section or support page.** Users looking for help are already thinking about what could be better.
- **After key interactions.** Post-onboarding, after resolving a support ticket, or after a feature is used for the first time.

**Supporting placements:**
- **Footer of your app or website.** Low traffic but catches users who are looking for it.
- **Support email signatures.** "Have a feature idea? Submit it at [portal link]."
- **Documentation site.** A "Give feedback" link in your docs navigation.

<Tip>
One high-value placement is worth more than five footer links. Prioritize the in-app link above everything else.
</Tip>

## Write the announcement

Don't launch silently. Tell your users the portal exists and why they should use it. Keep the announcement short - what it is, why they should care, one clear call to action.

Here's a template you can adapt:

> **We want to hear from you.**
>
> We just launched a feedback portal where you can submit ideas, report issues, and vote on what we build next. Your input directly shapes our roadmap.
>
> **[Submit your first idea →]**
>
> Every submission gets reviewed by our team. You'll get notified when we update the status of your feedback.

Send this through whatever channel reaches your users: email, in-app notification, blog post, or Slack community. Match the tone to your brand.

**Where to post it:**
- Email to active users (highest impact)
- In-app banner or notification (catches users in context)
- Blog post (good for SEO and public commitment)
- Social media or community channels (broad reach)

## Seed it with content

An empty portal is a dead portal. Nobody wants to be the first person to post on a blank page.

Before you announce, add 3-5 posts from your existing backlog. Pull from:

- Feature requests you've already received via email or support
- Ideas your team has discussed but not committed to
- Known pain points users have mentioned in conversations

Vote on them yourself. Add a comment or two. The goal is to make the portal feel active and lived-in when the first user arrives.

<Note>
Don't import your entire backlog. Pick the posts that are most relevant and likely to get engagement. You can always add more later.
</Note>

## Set expectations

Tell users what happens after they submit feedback. Silence is the number-one reason users stop contributing. Even a brief explanation builds trust.

Add this to your portal's description or announcement:

- **What you'll do:** "We review every submission weekly."
- **How they'll know:** "You'll get notified when we update the status of your post."
- **What to expect:** "Not every idea will be built, but every one is read."

The key is honesty. "We review feedback weekly and prioritize based on impact and feasibility" is better than "We'll build everything you ask for." Users respect transparency about constraints.

## The launch checklist

Before you announce, verify:

- [ ] Portal is branded (logo, colors)
- [ ] At least one board is set up
- [ ] 3-5 seed posts are live with votes
- [ ] Portal link is placed in-app
- [ ] Authentication is configured (see [Set up portal sign-in](/admin/portal-auth))
- [ ] Announcement is drafted
- [ ] You have time to respond to initial feedback within 48 hours

That last point matters most. The first week sets the tone. If users submit feedback and hear nothing for two weeks, they'll assume the portal is abandoned. Block time on your calendar for the first week to respond promptly.

## After launch

Watch for these signals in the first two weeks:

- **Users are posting.** Great. Respond to everything, even if it's just "Thanks, we've seen this."
- **Users are voting but not posting.** Normal. Voting is lower friction. The seed posts are working.
- **Nobody is posting.** Check your link placement. Is the portal easy to find? Is the announcement reaching the right people? Consider a follow-up nudge.
- **You're getting spam or off-topic posts.** Tighten authentication or add a description to your board clarifying what belongs there.

Don't panic if volume is low at first. Feedback portals grow over time as users see that their input leads to action. That's what the next modules are about.

Your portal is live. Now you need a system for handling what comes in. Next: [Triage feedback effectively](/guides/triage-feedback-effectively).
