# Guides

Quackback gives you the tools. These guides show you how to use them well.

This is a structured course that takes you from "just deployed" to "running a mature feedback operation." Each lesson is opinionated, practical, and builds on the previous ones. Work through them in order at your own pace, or jump to the module that matches where you are right now.

## Module 1: Foundation

Go from "Quackback is installed" to "portal is live and users are submitting feedback."

Most feedback programs fail before they start because the team skips straight to configuration without thinking about what they're trying to learn. These three lessons make sure your foundation is solid.

1. [Define your feedback strategy](/guides/define-your-feedback-strategy): Set goals before touching settings so you collect signal, not noise.
2. [Structure your workspace](/guides/structure-your-workspace): Set up boards, statuses, and tags that match how your team actually works.
3. [Launch your portal](/guides/launch-your-portal): Introduce your feedback portal to users so they actually use it.

## Module 2: Daily Operations

Develop a repeatable rhythm for processing feedback without it consuming your day.

Feedback piles up fast. Without a system, you'll either ignore it (guilt) or drown in it (burnout). These lessons give you a sustainable daily and weekly routine.

4. [Triage feedback effectively](/guides/triage-feedback-effectively): A repeatable process for reviewing feedback without letting it pile up.
5. [Write responses users love](/guides/write-responses-users-love): Communicate with users in a way that builds trust, even when saying no.
6. [Merge and organize](/guides/merge-and-organize): Keep your feedback clean as volume grows by merging duplicates and staying organized.

## Module 3: Prioritization

Turn raw feedback into a plan your team can execute on.

You have feedback flowing in and a rhythm for processing it. Now the hard part: deciding what to build. These lessons help you read the data, build a roadmap, and get your team aligned.

7. [Read the signals](/guides/read-the-signals): Use votes, segments, and patterns to understand what users actually need.
8. [Build your roadmap](/guides/build-your-roadmap): Turn prioritized feedback into a public plan that builds trust.
9. [Align your team](/guides/align-your-team): Get product, engineering, and support working from the same feedback source.

## Module 4: Closing the Loop

Make users feel heard by connecting feedback to shipped features.

This is the payoff. When users see their feedback turn into shipped features, they become advocates. When they don't, they stop contributing. These lessons close the gap.

10. [Ship and announce](/guides/ship-and-announce): Write changelog entries that make users feel their feedback mattered.
11. [Measure and iterate](/guides/measure-and-iterate): Review your feedback program's health and improve it over time.

## Module 5: Scale

Handle growing volume and complexity without burning out.

What works for 50 users breaks at 500. These lessons cover segmentation, automation, and migration for teams that have outgrown the basics.

12. [Segment your users](/guides/segment-your-users): Filter feedback by customer group to prioritize the voices that matter most.
13. [Automate your workflow](/guides/automate-your-workflow): Connect integrations and reduce manual work as your feedback volume grows.
14. [Migrate from another tool](/guides/migrate-from-another-tool): Move from Canny, UserVoice, or a spreadsheet without losing data or momentum.

## How to use these guides

Each guide is 5-10 minutes of reading. They link to the relevant feature docs when you need to know which button to click. The guides focus on the _why_ and _when_ - the feature docs cover the _how_.

If you're just getting started, begin with [Define your feedback strategy](/guides/define-your-feedback-strategy) and work through Module 1. You'll have a live portal by the end.

If you're already collecting feedback, jump to Module 2 or wherever you feel the most friction.
