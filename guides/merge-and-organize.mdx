# Merge and organize

As feedback volume grows, duplicates accumulate, tags drift, and boards get cluttered. This isn't failure - it's normal. What matters is having maintenance habits that prevent chaos. This lesson covers the organizational practices that keep your feedback useful.

## Finding duplicates

Before you change any post's status, search for similar posts. Duplicates are the number-one source of noise in a feedback portal. Five separate posts about "dark mode" with 3 votes each look like low demand. One canonical post with 15 merged votes tells a different story.

**How to spot them:**

- **Check similar posts.** Quackback surfaces similar posts automatically. Review these before triaging a new post.
- **Search by keyword.** Users describe the same idea in different ways. "Dark mode," "night theme," "dark theme," and "reduce eye strain" could all be the same request. Search for variations.
- **Watch for clusters.** If you see three posts in a week about related pain points, there's probably a unifying theme worth consolidating.

<Tip>
Make duplicate-checking part of your daily triage. It takes 30 seconds per post and prevents vote fragmentation.

## When to merge vs. keep separate

Not every similar post is a duplicate. Here's the decision framework:

**Merge when:**
- The posts describe the same user need, even in different words
- A single implementation would satisfy both requests
- Users would be happy with a single post representing their feedback

**Keep separate when:**
- The posts describe the same category but different implementations ("dark mode for the app" vs. "dark mode for email notifications" - these are different pieces of work)
- The scope is meaningfully different ("basic CSV export" vs. "full data warehouse integration")
- Different user segments are asking for different reasons (same feature, but the context matters for prioritization)

When in doubt, keep them separate. You can always merge later, but un-merging is harder to undo cleanly.

## The merge workflow

When you find a duplicate:

1. Open the duplicate post (the one you want to close).
2. Click **Mark as duplicate** and search for the canonical post (the one you want to keep).
3. Votes from the duplicate are consolidated into the canonical post automatically.
4. The duplicate stays visible so future searchers find it and get redirected.

**Choosing the canonical post:** Pick the post with the better description, more votes, or more discussion. If they're equal, pick the older one.

See [Merge duplicate posts](/admin/inbox#merge-duplicate-posts) for step-by-step instructions.

## Tag hygiene

Tags are only useful if they're consistent. Without periodic cleanup, you end up with "mobile", "Mobile", "mobile-app", and "iOS" all meaning the same thing.

**Monthly tag review (10 minutes):**

1. Open [Tags](/admin/tags) and review the full list.
2. **Low-usage tags.** If a tag has fewer than 3 posts, it's probably not earning its keep. Consider removing it or merging it into a broader tag.
3. **Redundant tags.** Combine "mobile" and "mobile-app" into one. Pick the simpler name.
4. **Missing tags.** Are there clusters of posts that should share a tag but don't? Add the tag and apply it retroactively.

**Tag naming conventions:**
- Use lowercase, hyphenated names: "mobile-app" not "Mobile App"
- Keep them short: "billing" not "billing-and-payments"
- Use broad categories: "api" covers REST, GraphQL, and webhooks unless you genuinely need to distinguish them

<Note>
Tags should help you filter and spot patterns. If you never filter by a tag, you don't need it.
</Note>

## When to reorganize boards

Boards should be stable. Reorganizing them is disruptive - bookmarks break, users get confused, and you have to recategorize existing posts. Only do it when the pain is real.

**Signs you need a new board:**
- A single board has 200+ posts and you find yourself wishing you could filter by type within it.
- An entire category of feedback (like integrations) has emerged that doesn't fit your existing boards.
- Different teams need to own different types of feedback.

**Signs you don't need a new board:**
- You just think it would be "cleaner" to separate things.
- You have fewer than 50 posts total.
- The proposed board would have fewer than 10 posts.

When you do split a board, move existing posts to the new board so historical feedback is in the right place. Announce the change to your team so everyone triages from the right place.

## The monthly cleanup routine

Set a recurring 30-minute calendar block once a month for feedback maintenance:

1. **Tag review (10 min).** Clean up redundant tags, remove unused ones, add missing ones.
2. **Duplicate scan (10 min).** Sort by recent posts and look for duplicates you missed during daily triage.
3. **Board health check (5 min).** Is any board overwhelmed? Is any board dead? Adjust if needed.
4. **Status audit (5 min).** Are there posts in "In Progress" that aren't actually being worked on? Update them.

This routine prevents the slow drift from "organized workspace" to "junk drawer." 30 minutes a month is cheap insurance.
