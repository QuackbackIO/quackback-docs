# Vote on feedback

Show your support for feedback you care about by voting.

## How Voting Works

Each user gets **one vote per post**. Votes help the team:
- Prioritize popular requests
- Understand user demand
- Make data-driven decisions

## Vote on posts

### From the List

1. Browse the feedback list
2. Click the **vote button** (upvote arrow icon) on any post
3. The vote count increases

### From the Post Detail

1. Open a post
2. Click the **vote button**
3. Your vote is registered

## Remove your vote

Changed your mind? Remove your vote:

1. Find the post you voted on
2. Click the vote button again
3. Your vote is removed

<Note>
Votes can be added and removed at any time.
</Note>

## Find posts to vote on

### Sort by Votes

Use the sort dropdown to find:
- **Top** - Most voted posts overall
- **Trending** - Recently popular posts
- **New** - Latest submissions

### Filter by Board

Focus on areas you care about:
- Feature Requests
- Integrations
- Your specific product area

### Search

Look for specific topics using the search bar.

## Your Voted Posts

Your votes are tracked automatically. Posts you've voted on display a highlighted vote button so you can easily see which items you've supported.

<Tip>
To track posts you care about, use the subscription bell on each post to follow updates. Check the **Notifications** page to see activity on posts you're subscribed to.
</Tip>

## Vote Notifications

Stay informed about posts you've voted on:

| Event | Notification |
|-------|--------------|
| Status change | "Feature X is now In Progress" |
| Shipped | "Feature X has shipped!" |
| Official response | "Team replied to Feature X" |

Configure notifications in your [account settings](/users/notifications).

## Voting Best Practices

### Vote Selectively

Your votes are a signal. Use them for items that truly matter to you.

### Look for Similar Posts

Before voting, check for duplicates. Vote for the existing post with the most engagement.

### Add Comments

If you have additional context, add a comment explaining your use case:
- Why this matters to you
- How you'd use it
- Your current workaround

### Avoid Vote Manipulation

<Warning>
Don't:
- Create multiple accounts to vote
- Ask others to vote without context
- Game the system

This undermines the feedback process and may result in vote removal.
</Warning>

## How Teams Use Votes

Votes are one factor in prioritization:

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Vote count | How many users want this |
| User segments | Which customers are asking |
| Strategic fit | Alignment with product vision |
| Effort | Development complexity |
| Dependencies | Technical requirements |

<Note>
High votes don't guarantee implementation, but they ensure visibility.

## Common Questions

### Why do I need to sign in to vote?

Authentication ensures:
- One vote per person
- You receive updates
- Votes are legitimate

### Can I vote on my own posts?

Yes! Your vote is automatically added when you submit feedback.

### Do votes expire?

No. Votes persist unless you remove them.

### Can I see who voted?

This depends on workspace settings. Some organizations show voter counts only; others show voter names.
