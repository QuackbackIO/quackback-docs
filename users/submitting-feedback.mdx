# Submitting Feedback

Share your ideas, report bugs, and request features through the feedback portal.

## Finding the Feedback Portal

Your organization's feedback portal is typically at:
- `feedback.yourcompany.com`
- `yourcompany.quackback.io`

Look for a "Feedback" or "Feature Request" link in the product you're using.

## Browsing Existing Feedback

Before submitting new feedback, check if someone else has already requested it:

1. **Search** - Use the search bar to find related posts
2. **Browse boards** - Look through relevant boards
3. **Check the roadmap** - See what's already planned

<Tip>
If you find an existing post, **vote for it** instead of creating a duplicate. This helps prioritize requests.
</Tip>

## Creating a New Post

### 1. Choose a Board

Select the appropriate board for your feedback:
- **Feature Requests** - New functionality you'd like to see
- **Bug Reports** - Issues you've encountered
- **Integrations** - Connections with other tools
- **Documentation** - Improvements to guides and help

### 2. Write a Clear Title

Your title should be:
- **Concise** - One sentence summarizing your request
- **Specific** - Include key details
- **Searchable** - Use common terms others might search for

**Good titles:**
- "Add dark mode support"
- "Export reports to PDF"
- "Slow loading on dashboard with 1000+ items"

**Avoid:**
- "Feature request" (too vague)
- "This is broken!!!" (not descriptive)
- "I think it would be really great if..." (unnecessary preamble)

### 3. Describe Your Feedback

In the description, include:

**For feature requests:**
- What you want to accomplish
- Why it's important to you
- How you currently work around it (if applicable)

**For bug reports:**
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Browser/device information

**For all feedback:**
- Context about your use case
- Examples if helpful
- Screenshots or recordings (if supported)

### 4. Submit

Click **Submit** or **Post** to publish your feedback.
