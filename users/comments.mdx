# Comment on posts

Join the discussion on feedback posts with comments.

## Add comments

2. Scroll to the comment section
3. Type your comment
4. Click **Comment** (or **Reply** for replies)

Replies appear nested under the original comment.

## Pinned Comments

Team members can **pin** a comment to highlight it at the top of the comment thread. Pinned comments are marked with a "Pinned" badge.

Pinned comments typically:
- Acknowledge the feedback
- Provide status updates
- Explain decisions
- Ask clarifying questions

## Status Changes in Comments

When a team member changes a post's status while leaving a comment, a status change indicator appears inline in the comment thread. This shows which status the post was changed from and to, giving readers context about how the conversation led to status updates.

## Private Comments

Team members can post private comments that are only visible to other team members. Use private comments for internal discussion - coordinate responses, share context, or discuss priorities without the conversation being visible to portal users.

### Post a private comment

1. Open any post
2. Click the **Private** button next to the submit button (lock icon)
3. Type your internal note
4. Click **Comment**

The button turns amber when private mode is active. Private comments display an amber left border and an "Internal note" badge to distinguish them from public comments.

### Reply to a private comment

Replies to private comments are always private. When you reply to an internal note, the private toggle is automatically enabled and locked - you don't need to toggle it manually.

<Note>
Private comments don't count toward the public comment count displayed on posts. They also don't trigger notifications to portal users - only team members who are subscribed to the post are notified.
</Note>

### Restrictions

- Only team members (admins and members) can post private comments
- Private comments can't be pinned as the official response
- Portal users and anonymous visitors never see private comments

## Comment Locking

Team members can lock comments on a post to prevent further discussion. When comments are locked:

- Portal users see a lock icon and a message explaining that comments are disabled
- Team members can still comment on locked posts

## Edit and delete comments

Comment editing and deletion are managed by workspace administrators. If you need to modify or remove a comment you've posted, contact the team through the feedback portal.

## Comment Notifications

Get notified about comment activity:

| Event | Notification |
|-------|--------------|
| Comment on posts you're subscribed to | Email/in-app |

Configure in [notification settings](/users/notifications).
