# Contributing

Help us build something great. Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a feature, or improving docs, this guide shows you how to contribute effectively and get your changes merged.

## Ways to Contribute

- **Bug reports** - Found a bug? Open an issue
- **Feature requests** - Have an idea? Start a discussion
- **Code contributions** - Fix bugs or add features
- **Documentation** - Improve guides and API docs
- **Translations** - Help localize the platform

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork the Repository

Click "Fork" on GitHub to create your own copy.

### 2. Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/quackback.git
cd quackback
```

### 3. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
bun run setup
bun run dev
```

See [Development Setup](/developers/setup) for detailed instructions.

### 4. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

## Making Changes

### Code Style

We use:
- **ESLint** for code linting
- **Prettier** for formatting
- **TypeScript** for type safety

Run checks before committing:

```bash
bun run lint
```

For type checking (in apps/web):
```bash
cd apps/web && bun run typecheck
```

### Naming Conventions

| Type | Convention | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Files | kebab-case | `user-profile.tsx` |
| Components | PascalCase | `UserProfile` |
| Functions | camelCase | `getUserProfile` |
| Database | snake_case | `post_tags` |

### Component Guidelines

- Use React Server Components by default
- Add `'use client'` only when needed (hooks, browser APIs)
- Keep components focused and small
- Extract complex logic to hooks or utilities

### Database Changes

When modifying the schema:

1. Edit files in `packages/db/src/schema/`
2. Generate migration: `bun run db:generate`
3. Test migration: `bun run db:migrate`
4. Verify with Drizzle Studio: `bun run db:studio`

## Testing

### Run Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
bun run test

# E2E tests
bun run test:e2e

# Specific test file
bun run test path/to/test.ts
```

### Writing Tests

Unit tests go next to the code:
```
lib/posts/
├── post.service.ts
└── post.service.test.ts
```

E2E tests are in `apps/web/e2e/`.

### Test Coverage

Aim for meaningful test coverage:
- Critical business logic
- Edge cases
- Error handling

## Submitting Changes

### 1. Commit Your Changes

Write clear commit messages:

```bash
# Good
git commit -m "fix: prevent duplicate votes on same post"
git commit -m "feat: add CSV export for posts"

# Bad
git commit -m "fixed stuff"
git commit -m "wip"
```

Follow conventional commits:
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance

### 2. Push to Your Fork

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Create a Pull Request

1. Go to the main Quackback repository
2. Click "Compare & pull request"
3. Fill in the PR template:
   - Description of changes
   - Related issues
   - Screenshots (if UI changes)
   - Testing done

### PR Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single change
- Include tests for new functionality
- Update documentation if needed
- Respond to review feedback promptly

## Review Process

1. **Automated checks** - CI runs tests and linting
2. **Code review** - Maintainers review your code
3. **Feedback** - Address any requested changes
4. **Merge** - Once approved, your PR is merged

### What Reviewers Look For

- Code quality and readability
- Test coverage
- Performance implications
- Security considerations
- Documentation updates
