# Self-Hosting Quackback

Quackback can be self-hosted on your own infrastructure for complete control over your data.

## Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL 15+ (or Neon serverless)
- Node.js 20+ (for development)

## Quick Start with Docker

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/QuackbackIO/quackback.git
cd quackback

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Start with Docker Compose
docker compose up -d
```

## Configuration

Edit your `.env` file with your settings:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/quackback

# Authentication
AUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key

# Email (optional)
RESEND_API_KEY=your-resend-key
```

## Production Deployment

For production deployments, we recommend:

- Using managed PostgreSQL (Neon, Supabase, or RDS)
- Setting up proper SSL/TLS
- Configuring backups

<Callout type="warning" title="Security">
Always use strong secrets in production and never commit your .env file.
</Callout>
