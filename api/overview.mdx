# API Overview

Build on Quackback. Whether you're syncing feedback to your issue tracker, automating status updates, or building custom dashboards, the REST API gives you full programmatic access to your data.

## Authentication

All API requests require an API key, passed as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl https://feedback.example.com/api/v1/posts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer qb_your_api_key_here"
```

### Create API keys

**[Dashboard]**

1. Go to **Admin > Settings > API Keys**
2. Click **Create API Key**
3. Give it a name (e.g., "CI/CD Integration")
4. Copy the key immediately - it's only shown once

API keys are prefixed with `qb_` and inherit the role of the team member who creates them. An admin's key has admin access; a member's key has member access.

### Role-Based Access

Endpoints enforce role-based authorization:

| Role Required | Who Can Access | Endpoints |
|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Team** (admin or member) | Any team member | Most endpoints - posts, boards, tags, statuses, roadmaps, comments |
| **Admin** | Admins only | Webhooks, changelog writes, member management, user deletion |

If your key doesn't have sufficient permissions, you'll receive a `403 Forbidden` response.

## Base URL

All API endpoints are under `/api/v1/`:

```
https://feedback.example.com/api/v1/posts
https://feedback.example.com/api/v1/boards
https://feedback.example.com/api/v1/tags
```

## Try the API

Once you have an API key, try these commands:

```bash
# List your boards
curl https://feedback.example.com/api/v1/boards \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer qb_your_api_key_here"

# Create a post
curl -X POST https://feedback.example.com/api/v1/posts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer qb_your_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"boardId": "board_01abc...", "title": "Add dark mode"}'
```

Replace `feedback.example.com` with your instance URL and `qb_your_api_key_here` with your API key.

## Request Format

**[Your App]** Send JSON in the request body for POST and PATCH requests:

```bash
curl -X POST https://feedback.example.com/api/v1/posts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer qb_your_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "boardId": "board_01h455vb4pex5vsknk084sn02q",
    "title": "Add dark mode support",
    "content": "It would be great to have a dark theme option."
  }'
```

## Response Format

### Success

Successful responses wrap the result in a `data` field:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "post_01h455vb4pex5vsknk084sn02q",
    "title": "Add dark mode support",
    "content": "It would be great to have a dark theme option.",
    "voteCount": 0,
    "boardId": "board_01h455vb4pex5vsknk084sn02q",
    "createdAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

List endpoints include pagination metadata:

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "meta": {
    "pagination": {
      "cursor": "eyJvZmZzZXQiOjIwfQ",
      "hasMore": true,
      "total": 150
    }
  }
}
```

### Error

Error responses include a code and message:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Title is required"
  }
}
```

| HTTP Status | Error Code | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| 400 | `BAD_REQUEST` | Invalid request body or parameters |
| 400 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | Input validation failed |
| 401 | `UNAUTHORIZED` | Missing or invalid API key |
| 403 | `FORBIDDEN` | Insufficient permissions for this operation |
| 404 | `NOT_FOUND` | Resource not found |
| 409 | `CONFLICT` | Duplicate resource (e.g., duplicate slug) |
| 429 | `RATE_LIMITED` | Too many requests |
| 500 | `INTERNAL_ERROR` | Unexpected server error |

## Pagination

List endpoints use cursor-based pagination:

```bash
# First page
curl "https://feedback.example.com/api/v1/posts?limit=20" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer qb_..."

# Next page (use cursor from previous response)
curl "https://feedback.example.com/api/v1/posts?limit=20&cursor=eyJvZmZzZXQiOjIwfQ" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer qb_..."
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `cursor` | string | - | Opaque cursor from a previous response |
| `limit` | number | 20 | Results per page (1–100) |

When `hasMore` is `true`, use the returned `cursor` value to fetch the next page. When `hasMore` is `false`, you've reached the end.

## Filtering

The posts endpoint supports filtering:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `boardId` | TypeID | Filter by board |
| `status` | string | Filter by status slug |
| `tagIds` | string | Comma-separated tag TypeIDs |
| `search` | string | Full-text search |
| `sort` | string | `newest` (default), `oldest`, or `votes` |

```bash
curl "https://feedback.example.com/api/v1/posts?boardId=board_01h4...&status=planned&sort=votes" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer qb_..."
```

## Rate Limiting

The API enforces rate limiting per client IP. When you exceed the limit, you'll receive a `429` response with a `Retry-After` header indicating how many seconds to wait.

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "RATE_LIMITED",
    "message": "Too many requests. Please try again later."
  }
}
```

Implement exponential backoff in your integration to handle rate limits gracefully.

## TypeIDs

All resource IDs are TypeIDs - branded, sortable UUIDs with a type prefix:

```
post_01h455vb4pex5vsknk084sn02q
board_01h455vb4pex5vsknk084sn02q
status_01h455vb4pex5vsknk084sn02q
tag_01h455vb4pex5vsknk084sn02q
```

The prefix tells you the resource type at a glance. TypeIDs are globally unique and sortable by creation time.
