# Share updates with changelog

Close the loop with your users. The changelog lets you announce what you've shipped and connect each update back to the feedback that inspired it.

## Overview

Access the changelog from **Admin > Changelog** in the sidebar. You can:

- Write and publish release notes
- Link changelog entries to feedback posts
- Schedule entries for future publication
- Filter entries by status (draft, scheduled, published)

## Create a changelog entry

1. Click **New Entry** in the top right
2. Enter a title and write your content using the rich text editor
3. Choose a publish state:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Draft** | Saved but not visible to users |
| **Scheduled** | Publishes automatically at the chosen date and time |
| **Published** | Live and visible on the public changelog |

4. Click **Save**

<Tip>
Start entries as drafts. Refine the copy, link related posts, then publish when you're ready.
</Tip>

## Link feedback posts

Connect changelog entries to the feedback that drove them. Linked posts appear as metadata on the entry, showing users their voice was heard.

1. Open a changelog entry in the editor
2. In the settings panel, find **Linked Posts**
3. Search and select the posts that shipped in this update

When users view a published changelog entry, they see which feedback posts were addressed.

## Edit and delete entries

Click any entry in the list to open its editor. You can update the title, content, publish state, and linked posts at any time.

To delete an entry, open it and click **Delete**. A confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion.

<Warning>
Deleting a changelog entry removes it permanently.
</Warning>

## Filter entries

Use the filter buttons at the top of the list to show:

- **All** - every entry regardless of status
- **Draft** - unpublished drafts
- **Scheduled** - entries awaiting their publish date
- **Published** - live entries
