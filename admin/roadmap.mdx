# Roadmap Management

Show users what you're building. A public roadmap builds trust. Users can see what's planned, in progress, and shipped, and follow updates on features they care about.

## How It Works

The roadmap displays posts grouped by status in a kanban-style layout. Each column represents a status you've marked as "Show on Roadmap" in your status settings.

Users can:
- See what's coming next
- Vote on planned features
- Subscribe to get notified when items ship

<Note>
Only posts you've explicitly added to a roadmap appear here. Not everything needs to be public. You control what's visible.
</Note>

## Creating a Roadmap

You can have multiple roadmaps for different purposes (e.g., "Product Roadmap", "API Roadmap").

1. Go to **Admin → Roadmap**
2. Click the **+** button in the sidebar
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Name** - Display name (e.g., "Product Roadmap")
   - **Description** - Optional description
   - **Public** - Toggle visibility to users
4. Click **Create**

## Adding Posts to the Roadmap

### From a Post's Detail Page

1. Open a post in **Admin → Feedback**
2. In the Properties panel, find the **Roadmaps** section
3. Click **"Add"**
4. Select which roadmap to add the post to

### Using Drag and Drop

Once posts are on a roadmap, you can drag them between columns to change their status:

1. Click and hold a post card
2. Drag to the target status column
3. Release to update

The post's status updates automatically.

<Tip>
This is the fastest way to update multiple posts at once. Great for sprint planning sessions!
</Tip>

## Removing a Post from Roadmap

1. Open the post in the detail page
2. In the Roadmaps section, click the **X** on the roadmap badge

The post stays in Quackback. It's just not shown on the roadmap anymore.

## Roadmap Visibility

Each roadmap can be public or private:

| Setting | Who can see it |
|---------|----------------|
| **Public** | Everyone visiting your portal |
| **Private** | Only team members (indicated by lock icon) |

<Tip>
Use a private roadmap for internal planning, then move items to your public roadmap when you're ready to announce them.
</Tip>

## Configuring Columns

The roadmap columns are determined by which statuses have "Show on Roadmap" enabled.

1. Go to **Admin → Settings → Statuses**
2. Use the toggle next to each status to enable/disable roadmap visibility
3. You must select exactly 3 statuses
4. Click **Save changes**

Most teams use: **Planned → In Progress → Shipped**

## What Users See

On your public roadmap, users can see:
- Post title
- Vote count
- Status badge
- Brief description preview

Users do **NOT** see:
- Internal notes
- Team comments
- Assignment details

## Best Practices

### Keep It Updated

<Warning>
An outdated roadmap undermines trust. Regularly:
- Move completed items to "Shipped"
- Add newly planned items
- Remove items that won't happen
</Warning>

### Show Meaningful Items Only

Don't clutter the roadmap with minor tasks. Focus on:
- Major features
- Popular requests (high vote count)
- Significant improvements

### Avoid Specific Dates

<Tip>
Unless you're certain, avoid committing to dates. Instead use:
- "Planned" for committed items
- Quarterly goals rather than specific dates
- "Exploring" for ideas still under consideration
</Tip>

### Celebrate Shipped

Keep recently shipped items visible temporarily:
- Users see progress happening
- Builds confidence in your team
- Archive old shipped items periodically

### Communicate Changes

When plans change (and they will):
- Update the roadmap promptly
- Add comments to affected posts explaining why
- Notify subscribers of significant shifts

## Editing a Roadmap

1. Hover over a roadmap in the sidebar
2. Click the **...** menu button
3. Select **Edit**
4. Update name, description, or visibility
5. Click **Save**

## Deleting a Roadmap

1. Hover over a roadmap in the sidebar
2. Click the **...** menu button
3. Select **Delete**
4. Confirm deletion

<Note>
Deleting a roadmap removes posts from that roadmap but does not delete the posts themselves. They're still in your feedback inbox.
</Note>

## Link from Your Product

Drive engagement by linking to your roadmap from your app:

- Footer links
- Help menu
- Feature request buttons

This turns your roadmap into a living communication channel with users.

## Next Steps

- [Statuses](/admin/statuses) - Configure which statuses appear on roadmaps
- [Inbox](/admin/inbox) - Manage feedback and add posts to roadmaps
- [Integrations](/integrations/overview) - Get notified on status changes
