# Roadmap Management

The roadmap gives users visibility into what you're working on and what's planned.

## Overview

Access the roadmap from **Admin → Roadmap** in the sidebar. The public roadmap is accessible from the public portal.

## How It Works

The roadmap displays posts grouped by status in a kanban-style layout with three columns representing the statuses you've marked as "Show on Roadmap" in your status settings.

<Note>
Only posts that have been added to a roadmap appear here.
</Note>

## Multiple Roadmaps

You can create multiple roadmaps for different purposes. The sidebar on the left shows all your roadmaps.

### Creating a Roadmap

1. Go to **Admin → Roadmap**
2. Click the **+** button in the Roadmaps sidebar header
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Name** - Display name (e.g., "Product Roadmap")
   - **Description** - Optional description
   - **Public** - Toggle visibility to users
4. Click **Create**

### Editing a Roadmap

1. Hover over a roadmap in the sidebar
2. Click the **...** menu button
3. Select **Edit**
4. Update the name, description, or visibility
5. Click **Save**

### Deleting a Roadmap

1. Hover over a roadmap in the sidebar
2. Click the **...** menu button
3. Select **Delete**
4. Confirm deletion

<Note>
Deleting a roadmap removes posts from that roadmap but does not delete the posts themselves.
</Note>

## Adding Posts to Roadmap

### From the Post Detail Page

1. Open a post in **Admin → Feedback**
2. In the Properties panel, find the Roadmaps section
3. Click **"Add"**
4. Select the roadmap to add the post to

### Managing the Roadmap View

Posts are displayed in columns based on their status. Drag posts between columns to change their status:

1. Click and hold a post card
2. Drag to the target status column
3. Release to update the status

The post's status is automatically updated.

### Removing from Roadmap

To remove a post from a roadmap:

1. Open the post in the detail page
2. In the Roadmaps section, click the X on the roadmap badge

## Roadmap Settings

### Visible Statuses

Control which statuses appear as columns on all roadmaps:

1. Go to **Admin → Settings → Statuses**
2. Use the toggle next to each status to enable/disable roadmap visibility
3. You must select exactly 3 statuses for the roadmap
4. Click **Save changes**

### Roadmap Visibility

Each roadmap can be set to public or private:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Public** | Visible to all visitors on the portal |
| **Private** | Only visible to team members (indicated by lock icon) |

## Public Roadmap

### User Experience

Visitors can:
- View planned and in-progress items
- Vote on roadmap items
- Subscribe to updates
- See what's recently shipped

### What Users See

The public roadmap shows:
- Post title
- Vote count
- Status badge
- Brief description preview

Users do NOT see:
- Internal notes
- Team comments
- Assignment details

## Best Practices

### Keep It Updated

<Warning>
An outdated roadmap undermines trust. Regularly:
- Move completed items to "Shipped"
- Add newly planned items
- Remove items that won't happen
</Warning>

### Meaningful Items Only

Don't clutter the roadmap with minor tasks. Show items users care about:
- Major features
- Popular requests
- Significant improvements

### Set Expectations

<Tip>
Avoid specific dates unless certain. Instead use:
- "Planned" for committed items
- "Exploring" for ideas under consideration
- Quarterly goals rather than specific dates
</Tip>

### Celebrate Shipped

Keep shipped items visible temporarily so users see progress:
- Show last 10-20 shipped items
- Archive old shipped items periodically
- Highlight major releases

### Communicate Changes

When plans change:
- Update the roadmap promptly
- Add comments explaining changes
- Notify subscribers of significant shifts

## Roadmap Analytics

Track engagement:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Views | Roadmap page visits |
| Votes | Votes on roadmap items |
| Subscriptions | Users following items |

Use these insights to understand what users care about most.

## Tips

### Organize by Theme

Group related items in the same column position:
- Authentication features together
- Mobile improvements grouped
- Performance items clustered

### Use Tags for Categorization

Apply tags to roadmap posts for filtering:
- `mobile`, `web`, `api`
- `enterprise`, `free-tier`
- `high-impact`, `quick-win`

### Link from Your Product

Add a "Roadmap" link in your app to drive engagement:
- Footer links
- Help menu
- Feature request buttons

## Next Steps

- [Statuses](/admin/statuses) - Configure which statuses appear on roadmaps
- [Feedback](/admin/inbox) - Manage feedback and add posts to roadmaps
- [Integrations](/integrations/overview) - Notify on status changes
