# Configure admin notifications

Never miss what matters. Get notified when users comment on posts you're tracking or when teammates change statuses so you can respond quickly and keep the conversation going.

## Overview

Access Notifications from **Admin → Notifications** in the sidebar. You'll see:

- New comments on posts you're subscribed to
- Status changes from teammates
- Activity that needs your attention

## Notifications Interface

### Header

The notifications header displays:

- **Total count** - Total number of notifications
- **Unread count** - Number of unread notifications (shown as badge)
- **Mark all as read** - Button to clear all unread indicators

### Notification List

Each notification shows:

- Activity type icon
- Post title and description
- Who triggered the notification
- When it happened
- Read/unread indicator

Click a notification to navigate to the relevant post.

## Notification Types

### Status Changes

Receive notifications when a post's status changes:

- Post moved from "Under Review" to "Planned"
- Post marked as "Shipped"
- Post status changed by another team member

### New Comments

Receive notifications when someone comments on a post you're subscribed to:

- Portal users adding feedback
- Team members responding
- Replies to existing comments

## Manage notifications

### Mark as Read

Click a notification to mark it as read and navigate to the post.

### Mark All as Read

Click **Mark all as read** in the header to clear all unread indicators.

## Subscriptions

You automatically receive notifications for:

- Posts you created
- Posts you commented on
- Posts you manually subscribed to

### Subscribe to a post

1. Open a post in the feedback view
2. Click the **Subscribe** button (or look for the bell icon)
3. You'll receive notifications for that post

### Unsubscribing

1. Open a post you're subscribed to
2. Click the **Unsubscribe** button
3. You'll stop receiving notifications for that post

<Tip>
Subscribe to high-priority posts to stay informed about customer feedback that matters most.
</Tip>

## Notification Behavior

### Real-time Updates

Notifications appear in real-time as activity happens. The unread count in the sidebar updates automatically.

### No Duplicates

You won't receive duplicate notifications for the same event, even if you're subscribed through multiple means (creator + commenter).

### Self-Actions

You won't receive notifications for your own actions (your own comments, status changes you make).

## Best Practices

### Manage Your Subscriptions

<Tip>
Keep your notifications relevant by:

1. Subscribing to high-priority posts you're working on
2. Unsubscribing from resolved posts
3. Checking notifications regularly to stay responsive
</Tip>

### Respond to feedback

When you receive a notification about a new comment:

1. Open the post from the notification
2. Review the comment context
3. Respond or take action as needed
4. The notification is marked as read

### Stay on top of changes

<Note>
Check notifications daily to catch status changes made by other team members. This helps maintain alignment on feedback priorities.
</Note>

## Access

All team members (Admins and Members) have access to the notifications page. Notifications are personal - you only see notifications for posts you're subscribed to.
