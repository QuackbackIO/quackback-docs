## Theme Mode

Control how light/dark mode works for portal visitors:
- **User choice (allow toggle)** - Visitors can switch between light and dark mode
- **Light only** - Portal always displays in light mode
- **Dark only** - Portal always displays in dark mode

## Color Scheme

Quackback offers two branding modes, toggled by the **Simple** / **Advanced** switch:

### Simple Mode

Customize your portal using color pickers and dropdowns:

#### Colors

Set your portal's color palette with the following inputs:

| Color | What it controls |
|-------|-----------------|
| Primary | Buttons, links, active states |
| Secondary | Secondary UI elements |
| Accent | Accent highlights |
| Background | Page background |
| Foreground (Text) | Main text color |

Click the color swatch to open the color picker, or type a hex code directly.

#### Font

Choose a font family from the dropdown. Fonts are organized by category:
- **Sans Serif** - Clean, modern fonts like Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, DM Sans, Geist, and more
- **Serif** - Traditional fonts like Playfair Display, Merriweather, Lora
- **Monospace** - Technical fonts like Fira Code, JetBrains Mono
- **System** - Uses the visitor's system font (System UI)

#### Corner Roundness

Adjust the roundness of buttons and cards using the slider:
- **Sharp** (left) - Square corners
- **Round** (right) - Fully rounded corners

A preview of the corner radius is shown next to the slider.

### Advanced Mode

For full control, use theme presets or write custom CSS:

- **Theme Presets** - Start from curated themes (e.g., Catppuccin, Supabase, Neo Brutalism)
- **Custom CSS** - Write custom CSS with `:root \{\}` and `.dark \{\}` blocks using CSS custom properties. Design your theme at [tweakcn.com](https://tweakcn.com) and paste it in.

## Preview

The right side of the branding page shows a live preview of your portal with the current settings. Use the **Light/Dark** toggle at the top of the preview to see how your branding looks in both modes.

## Save changes

After making changes, click **Save Changes** at the bottom of the controls panel to apply them to your portal. Identity changes (logo and workspace name) save automatically.

## Best Practices

### Consistent Branding

<Tip>
Match your existing brand guidelines:
- Use your official brand colors
- Use the same fonts as your main website
- Upload your standard logo
</Tip>

### Accessibility

<Warning>
Ensure good color contrast:
- Test text readability on colored backgrounds
- Verify the logo is visible on both light and dark themes
- Check button text visibility
</Warning>

### Mobile Experience

Preview on mobile viewport:
- Ensure the logo scales properly
- Verify touch targets are large enough
- Test dark mode on mobile

### Minimalism

Less is often more:
- A clean, simple design builds trust
- Avoid overly bright or clashing colors
- Let content be the focus
