# Triage feedback in the inbox

## Overview

Access the feedback view from **Admin → Feedback** in the sidebar. You can:

- See all feedback across boards in one place
- Filter by status, board, or tags to focus your work
- Update statuses and respond to users inline
- Add promising ideas to your public roadmap

## Tips

### Process workflow

<Tip>
Follow this workflow for efficient feedback processing:

1. **Triage new posts** - Review "Under Review" posts daily
2. **Merge duplicates** - Combine similar requests
3. **Categorize** - Apply tags for organization
4. **Respond** - Add comments to engage users
5. **Prioritize** - Move high-value items to "Planned"
</Tip>

### Find duplicates

Use the search function to find similar posts before marking as "Planned". Consider merging duplicate requests to consolidate votes.

### Engage users

<Note>
Respond to posts even if you won't implement them. Users appreciate acknowledgment:

- Thank them for the feedback
- Explain your reasoning
- Suggest alternatives if available
</Note>
