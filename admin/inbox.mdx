# Triage feedback in the inbox

Stop context-switching between tools. The feedback view is your command center. See everything users are asking for, triage quickly, and respond without leaving the page.

## Overview

Access the feedback view from **Admin → Feedback** in the sidebar. You can:

- See all feedback across boards in one place
- Filter by status, board, or tags to focus your work
- Update statuses and respond to users inline
- Add promising ideas to your public roadmap

## Feedback Interface

### List View

The feedback list displays posts in rows with:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Votes | Vote count with upvote indicator |
| Title | Post title with content preview |
| Status | Current workflow status badge |
| Board | Which board the post belongs to |
| Tags | Applied tags (if any) |
| Date | When the post was submitted |

Click any row to navigate to the post detail page.

### Post Detail Page

When you click a post, you're taken to the detail page which shows:

- Complete content with formatting
- Comment thread (including private internal notes visible only to team members)
- Properties panel (Status, Board, Tags, Roadmaps)
- Author information

## View Tabs

Quick-filter tabs at the top of the feedback list let you jump between common views:

| Tab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **All** | Every post, no preset filters |
| **Top Voted** | Posts sorted by vote count (highest first) |
| **Unresponded** | Posts with no team response yet |
| **Stale** | Posts with an active status that haven't been updated in 30+ days |

<Tip>
Use the **Stale** tab in your weekly review to catch posts that may have fallen through the cracks.
</Tip>

## Filtering

Use the filter sidebar to narrow down posts:

### By Status
Filter by workflow status. Click a status to select it, or Ctrl/Cmd+click to select multiple statuses.

### By Board
Select one or more boards to filter by feedback type.

### By Tags
Show posts with specific tags applied. Click tags to toggle them on/off.

### By Segment
Filter feedback by [user segment](/admin/segments). Select a segment to see only posts from users in that group -- useful for understanding what enterprise customers or free-tier users are asking for.

### By Owner
Filter by the team member assigned to a post. Select a name from the "Assigned to" dropdown, or choose "Unassigned" to find posts that haven't been picked up yet.

### By Date Range
Filter posts created within a specific timeframe. Set a start date, end date, or both.

### By Minimum Votes
Set a vote threshold to surface high-demand requests. Posts with fewer votes are hidden.

### Search
Use the search bar at the top to search across titles and content.

## Sorting

Sort posts using the dropdown next to the search bar:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Newest | Most recently created first |
| Oldest | Oldest posts first |
| Votes | Highest vote count first |

## Post Actions

### Change Status

From the list view:
1. Hover over a post row
2. Use the quick status dropdown that appears on the right

From the detail page:
1. Click the status in the Properties panel
2. Choose the new status from the dropdown

**While commenting**: Team members can also change a post's status directly from the comment form. A status selector appears next to the comment button, letting you update the status and leave a comment in one action. The status change is displayed inline in the comment thread.

### Private Comments

Team members can post private comments for internal-only discussion. Click the **Private** button (lock icon) next to the submit button to toggle private mode - the button turns amber when active. Private comments display with an amber left border and an "Internal note" badge to distinguish them from public comments.

Private comments are only visible to other team members. Portal users and anonymous visitors never see them, and they don't count toward the public comment count. Replies to private comments are always private automatically.

<Note>
Private comments don't trigger notifications to portal users - only team members who are subscribed to the post are notified.
</Note>

### Add Tags

1. Open a post in the detail page
2. In the Properties panel, click "Add" next to Tags
3. Select tags from the dropdown

To remove a tag, click the X on the tag badge.

### Add to Roadmap

1. Open a post in the detail page
2. In the Properties panel, find the Roadmaps section
3. Click "Add" and select a roadmap

Posts on roadmaps appear in the public roadmap view.

### Assign an Owner

Assign a team member to take responsibility for a post:

1. Open the post detail page
2. Use the owner dropdown in the properties panel
3. Select a team member, or clear the assignment

Filter the inbox by owner to see your assigned posts or find unassigned work.

### View Voters

See who voted on a post and where their votes came from:

1. Open a post with at least one vote
2. In the properties panel, click **Voters** next to the vote count
3. A modal lists each voter with their name and source

Votes from integrations (like Zendesk or Intercom) show the originating platform and a link back to the source ticket or conversation.

### Merge Duplicate Posts

Combine duplicate feedback to consolidate votes and discussion:

1. Open a post you want to mark as a duplicate
2. Click **Mark as duplicate** in the post header
3. Search for the canonical post (the one to keep)
4. Review the match and confirm the merge

After merging, the duplicate shows a banner linking to the canonical post. Votes are combined. The canonical post displays a "Merged Feedback" section listing all duplicates.

To reverse a merge, open the canonical post, find the merged post in the list, and click **Unmerge**.

<Tip>
Use the search function to find potential duplicates before merging. The search dialog shows match confidence to help you decide.
</Tip>

### Delete and Restore Posts

Posts can be soft-deleted from the edit dialog or post menu. Deleted posts are hidden from public views but preserved for 30 days.

To view deleted posts, enable the **Show deleted** toggle in filters. To restore a deleted post, open it and click **Restore**.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `ArrowDown` | Navigate to next post |
| `k` / `ArrowUp` | Navigate to previous post |
| `Enter` | Open selected post |
| `Esc` | Clear focus |
| `/` | Focus search input |

## Tips

### Process workflow

<Tip>
Follow this workflow for efficient feedback processing:

1. **Triage new posts** - Review "Open" posts daily
2. **Merge duplicates** - Combine similar requests
3. **Categorize** - Apply tags for organization
4. **Respond** - Add comments to engage users
5. **Prioritize** - Move high-value items to "Planned"
</Tip>

### Find duplicates

Use the search function to find similar posts before changing their status. Consider merging duplicate requests to consolidate votes.

### Engage users

<Note>
Respond to posts even if you won't implement them. Users appreciate acknowledgment:

- Thank them for the feedback
- Explain your reasoning
- Suggest alternatives if available
</Note>
