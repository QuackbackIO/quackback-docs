- View all feedback in one place
- Filter and search for specific posts
- Update statuses, assign tags, and manage posts
- Add posts to roadmaps

Click any row to navigate to the post detail page.

## Tips

### Processing Workflow

<Tip>
Follow this workflow for efficient feedback processing:

1. **Triage new posts** - Review "Under Review" posts daily
2. **Merge duplicates** - Combine similar requests
3. **Categorize** - Apply tags for organization
4. **Respond** - Add comments to engage users
5. **Prioritize** - Move high-value items to "Planned"
</Tip>

### Finding Duplicates

Use the search function to find similar posts before marking as "Planned". Consider merging duplicate requests to consolidate votes.

### Engaging Users

<Note>
Respond to posts even if you won't implement them. Users appreciate acknowledgment:

- Thank them for the feedback
- Explain your reasoning
- Suggest alternatives if available
</Note>
