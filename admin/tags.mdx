# Categorize posts with tags

Need to track which feedback affects mobile vs web? Or which requests are from enterprise customers? Tags let you slice feedback any way you need, across boards, statuses, and teams.

## Overview

Tags are created on the fly as you work. Apply them from any post's detail page. No separate settings to manage.

Tags differ from other organization methods:

| Feature | Tags | Boards | Statuses |
|---------|------|--------|----------|
| Multiple per post | Yes | No | No |
| User-facing category | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Workflow stage | No | No | Yes |
| Content type | No | Yes | No |

## Create tags

<Note>
Tags are automatically created when they're used during CSV import. New tags referenced in your import file will be created automatically.
</Note>

## Apply tags

### From Post Detail

1. Navigate to a post in **Admin → Feedback**
2. Click the post to open the detail page
3. In the Properties panel on the left, find the Tags section
4. Click **"Add"** to see available tags
5. Select a tag to apply it

### Remove tags

1. Open a post in the detail page
2. In the Properties panel, click the X on any tag badge to remove it

## Filter by tags

### In the Feedback View

1. In the filter sidebar, find the **Tags** section
2. Click tags to toggle them on/off
3. View matching posts

### Combine filters

Tags combine with other filters:
- Board + Tag
- Status + Tag
- Search + Tag

## Best Practices

### Start Simple

<Tip>
Begin with 5-10 tags. Add more as patterns emerge.
</Tip>

### Consistent Naming

Use a naming convention:
- Lowercase
- Hyphenated
- Short and clear

### Avoid Overlap

Don't duplicate information:
- Use boards for content type (features vs bugs)
- Use statuses for workflow stage
- Use tags for cross-cutting concerns

## Next Steps

- [Managing Feedback](/admin/inbox) - Use tags to filter feedback
- [Statuses](/admin/statuses) - Workflow stages
- [Boards](/admin/boards) - Content categories
