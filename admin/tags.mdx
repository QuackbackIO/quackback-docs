# Managing Tags

Tags provide additional categorization for feedback posts, complementing boards and statuses.

## Overview

Tags are managed inline while working with posts. There is no separate tags settings page - tags are created and applied directly from the post detail page.

Tags differ from other organization methods:

| Feature | Tags | Boards | Statuses |
|---------|------|--------|----------|
| Multiple per post | Yes | No | No |
| User-facing category | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Workflow stage | No | No | Yes |
| Content type | No | Yes | No |

## Creating Tags

<Note>
Tags are automatically created when they're used during CSV import. New tags referenced in your import file will be created automatically.
</Note>

## Applying Tags

### From Post Detail

1. Navigate to a post in **Admin → Feedback**
2. Click the post to open the detail page
3. In the Properties panel on the left, find the Tags section
4. Click **"Add"** to see available tags
5. Select a tag to apply it

### Removing Tags

1. Open a post in the detail page
2. In the Properties panel, click the X on any tag badge to remove it

## Filtering by Tags

### In the Feedback View

1. In the filter sidebar, find the **Tags** section
2. Click tags to toggle them on/off
3. View matching posts

### Combining Filters

- Board + Tag
- Status + Tag
- Search + Tag

## Best Practices

### Start Simple

<Tip>
Begin with 5-10 tags. Add more as patterns emerge.
</Tip>

### Consistent Naming

Use a naming convention:
- Lowercase
- Hyphenated
- Short and clear

### Avoid Overlap

Don't duplicate information:
- Use boards for content type (features vs bugs)
- Use statuses for workflow stage
- Use tags for cross-cutting concerns

## Next Steps

- [Managing Feedback](/admin/inbox) - Use tags to filter feedback
- [Statuses](/admin/statuses) - Workflow stages
- [Boards](/admin/boards) - Content categories
