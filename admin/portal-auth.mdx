# Portal Authentication

Configure which authentication methods are available to users signing in to your public feedback portal.

## Overview

Access Portal Authentication from **Admin → Settings → Portal Authentication**. Here you can control how your customers and users sign in to submit feedback.

<Note>
Portal Authentication controls **portal user** sign-in (customers submitting feedback). For **team member** authentication (employees managing feedback), see [Security](/admin/security).
</Note>

## Authentication Methods

### Email (Magic Link)

Allow users to sign in using magic link codes sent to their email.

- **How it works**: User enters email → receives 6-digit code → enters code to sign in
- **Best for**: Maximum accessibility, no third-party accounts needed
- **Enabled by default**: Yes

### GitHub

Allow users to sign in using their GitHub accounts.

- **How it works**: User clicks "Continue with GitHub" → authorizes access → signed in
- **Best for**: Developer-focused products

### Google

Allow users to sign in using their Google accounts.

- **How it works**: User clicks "Continue with Google" → authorizes access → signed in
- **Best for**: Consumer products, business tools

### Custom OpenID Connect (OIDC)

Connect your own identity provider to let users sign in with existing accounts.

- **Supported providers**: Okta, Auth0, Azure AD, Keycloak, and any OIDC-compliant provider
- **Best for**: Enterprise customers requiring SSO

## Configuring Sign-in Methods

### Enable/Disable Methods

1. Navigate to **Admin → Settings → Portal Authentication**
2. Toggle each method on or off using the switches
3. Changes save automatically

<Warning>
At least one authentication method must remain enabled. The last enabled method shows a lock icon and cannot be disabled.
</Warning>

## Setting Up OpenID Connect

To configure a custom identity provider:

1. Click the **gear icon** next to "Custom OpenID Connect"
2. Fill in the configuration form:

### Required Fields

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Button Label | Text shown on the sign-in button | "Acme Corp SSO" |
| Issuer URL | Your identity provider's base URL | `https://acme.okta.com` |
| Client ID | OAuth client ID from your IdP | `0oa1234567890` |
| Client Secret | OAuth client secret from your IdP | (hidden) |

### Optional Fields

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Email Domain Restriction | Only allow users from this domain | `acme.com` |

### Testing the Connection

1. Enter your Issuer URL
2. Click the **Test** button
3. Wait for validation:
   - ✅ Green checkmark = OIDC endpoints verified
   - ❌ Red warning = Check your issuer URL

### Saving Configuration

Click **Save & Enable** to save and activate the OIDC connection.

<Tip>
Use the "Test" button to verify your issuer URL is correct before entering client credentials.
</Tip>

## Managing OIDC Configuration

### Editing Configuration

1. Click the gear icon next to "Custom OpenID Connect"
2. Update the fields as needed
3. Leave Client Secret empty to keep the existing value
4. Click **Save Changes**

### Removing Configuration

1. Click the gear icon
2. Click the **Remove** button at the bottom
3. Confirm the removal

<Warning>
Removing OIDC configuration will immediately disable that sign-in method. Users who only have OIDC accounts won't be able to sign in until you re-configure it or they create accounts with another method.
</Warning>

## Identity Provider Setup

### Okta

1. Create a new "Web" application in Okta
2. Set redirect URI to: `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback/oidc`
3. Copy Client ID and Client Secret
4. Use your Okta domain as the Issuer URL

### Auth0

1. Create a new "Regular Web Application" in Auth0
2. Set callback URL to: `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback/oidc`
3. Copy Client ID and Client Secret
4. Use `https://your-tenant.auth0.com` as the Issuer URL

### Azure AD

1. Register a new application in Azure AD
2. Add redirect URI: `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback/oidc`
3. Create a client secret
4. Use `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/v2.0` as the Issuer URL

## Best Practices

### Choosing Methods

<Tip>
Consider your user base when selecting authentication methods:

- **Developer products** → Enable GitHub
- **Business products** → Enable Google
- **Enterprise customers** → Configure OIDC
- **Maximum accessibility** → Keep Email enabled
</Tip>

### Security Recommendations

1. **Enable multiple methods** - Provides fallback if one method has issues
2. **Use OIDC for enterprise** - Allows customers to use their corporate credentials
3. **Domain restrictions** - Use email domain restriction for OIDC to limit access

### User Experience

- Fewer options = simpler sign-in experience
- More options = greater accessibility
- Find the right balance for your users

## Access Control

Only **Admins** can modify portal authentication settings.

| Role | Can View | Can Modify |
|------|----------|------------|
| Admin | Yes | Yes |
| Member | No | No |
