# Set up portal sign-in

Let users sign in the way they prefer. Enable email magic links for simplicity, or OAuth with GitHub and Google for convenience.

## Overview

Access Portal Authentication from **Admin → Settings → Portal Authentication**. Control which sign-in methods appear on your feedback portal.

<Note>
Portal Authentication controls **portal user** sign-in (customers submitting feedback). For **team member** authentication (employees managing feedback), see [Security](/admin/security).
</Note>

## Authentication Methods

### Email (Magic Link)

Allow users to sign in using magic link codes sent to their email.

- **How it works**: User enters email → receives 6-digit code → enters code to sign in
- **Best for**: Maximum accessibility, no third-party accounts needed
- **Enabled by default**: Yes

### GitHub

Allow users to sign in using their GitHub accounts.

- **How it works**: User clicks "Continue with GitHub" → authorizes access → signed in
- **Best for**: Developer-focused products
- **Enabled by default**: Yes

### Google

Allow users to sign in using their Google accounts.

- **How it works**: User clicks "Continue with Google" → authorizes access → signed in
- **Best for**: Consumer products, business tools
- **Enabled by default**: Yes

## Configure sign-in methods

### Enable/Disable Methods

1. Navigate to **Admin → Settings → Portal Authentication**
2. Toggle each method on or off using the switches
3. Changes save automatically

<Warning>
At least one authentication method must remain enabled. The last enabled method shows a lock icon and cannot be disabled.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

### Choose methods

<Tip>
Consider your user base when selecting authentication methods:

- **Developer products** → Enable GitHub
- **Business products** → Enable Google
- **Maximum accessibility** → Keep Email enabled
</Tip>

### Security Recommendations

1. **Enable multiple methods** - Provides fallback if one method has issues
2. **Keep Email enabled** - Ensures all users can access the portal regardless of OAuth provider availability

### User Experience

- Fewer options = simpler sign-in experience
- More options = greater accessibility
- Find the right balance for your users

## Access Control

Only **Admins** can modify portal authentication settings.

| Role | Can View | Can Modify |
|------|----------|------------|
| Admin | Yes | Yes |
| Member | No | No |

## Next Steps

- [Team Members](/admin/team) - Manage your team and their authentication
- [Boards](/admin/boards) - Organize your feedback
