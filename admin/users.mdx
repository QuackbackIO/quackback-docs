# Portal Users

View and manage all users who have signed up to submit feedback on your public portal.

## Overview

Access Portal Users from **Admin → Users** in the sidebar. Here you can:

- View all portal users and their activity
- Filter by verification status and date
- Search for specific users
- View user details and activity

<Note>
Portal Users are different from Team Members. Portal users are your customers who submit and vote on feedback. Team members are your employees who manage feedback in the admin dashboard.
</Note>

## Users Interface

### List View

The user list displays accounts in rows with:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Avatar | User's profile picture or initials |
| Name | Display name |
| Email | Email address |
| Status | Verified/Unverified badge |
| Date | When they signed up |

Click any row to view user details in the side panel.

### User Detail Panel

When you select a user, the detail panel shows:

- Profile information (name, email, avatar)
- Account status (verified/unverified)
- Sign-up date
- Activity summary

## Filtering

Use the filter sidebar to narrow down users:

### By Verification Status

Filter users by their email verification status:

- **All** - Show all users
- **Verified** - Only email-verified users
- **Unverified** - Users who haven't verified their email

### By Date Range

Filter by when users signed up:

1. Click the date filter
2. Select a start date
3. Optionally select an end date

### Search

Use the search bar to find users by name or email.

## Sorting

Sort users using the dropdown:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Newest | Most recently signed up first |
| Oldest | Oldest accounts first |
| Most Active | Users with most posts/votes first |
| Name | Alphabetical by name |

## User Actions

### View User Activity

1. Select a user from the list
2. View their posts and votes in the detail panel

### Remove User

<Warning>
Removing a user is permanent and cannot be undone. This removes their account but preserves their posts and votes.
</Warning>

1. Select the user
2. Click the **Remove** button in the detail panel
3. Confirm the removal

## Best Practices

### User Engagement

<Tip>
Check the Portal Users page regularly to understand your user base:

- **Growth trends** - Are new users signing up?
- **Verification rates** - Are users confirming their emails?
- **Active users** - Who's providing the most feedback?
</Tip>

### Managing Spam

If you notice spam accounts:

1. Filter by "Unverified" status
2. Review recent sign-ups
3. Remove suspicious accounts
