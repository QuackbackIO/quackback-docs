# Manage portal users

Know your users. See who's signed up, who's most active, and who's giving you the best feedback. Spot trends in your user base and identify your power users.

## Overview

Access Portal Users from **Admin → Users** in the sidebar. You can:

- See all users who've signed up to give feedback
- Find your most active contributors
- Filter by verification status or sign-up date
- Search by name or email

<Note>
Portal Users are different from Team Members. Portal users are your customers who submit and vote on feedback. Team members are your employees who manage feedback in the admin dashboard.
</Note>

## Users Interface

### List View

The user list displays accounts in rows with:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Avatar | User's profile picture or initials |
| Name | Display name |
| Email | Email address |
| Status | Verified/Unverified badge |
| Date | When they signed up |

Click any row to view user details in the side panel.

### User Detail Panel

When you select a user, the detail panel shows:

- Profile information (name, email, avatar)
- Account status (verified/unverified)
- Sign-up date
- Activity summary

## Filtering

Use the filter sidebar to narrow down users:

### By Verification Status

Filter users by their email verification status:

- **All** - Show all users
- **Verified** - Only email-verified users
- **Unverified** - Users who haven't verified their email

### By Date Range

Filter by when users signed up:

1. Click the date filter
2. Select a start date
3. Optionally select an end date

### Search

Use the search bar to find users by name or email.

## Sorting

Sort users using the dropdown:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Newest | Most recently signed up first |
| Oldest | Oldest accounts first |
| Most Active | Users with most posts/votes first |
| Name | Alphabetical by name |

## User Actions

### View User Activity

1. Select a user from the list
2. View their posts and votes in the detail panel

### Remove User

<Warning>
Removing a user is permanent and cannot be undone. This removes their account but preserves their posts and votes.
</Warning>

1. Select the user
2. Click the **Remove** button in the detail panel
3. Confirm the removal

## Best Practices

### User Engagement

<Tip>
Check the Portal Users page regularly to understand your user base:

- **Growth trends** - Are new users signing up?
- **Verification rates** - Are users confirming their emails?
- **Active users** - Who's providing the most feedback?
</Tip>

### Manage spam

If you notice spam accounts:

1. Filter by "Unverified" status
2. Review recent sign-ups
3. Remove suspicious accounts
