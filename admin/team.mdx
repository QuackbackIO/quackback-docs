# Manage your team

Don't manage feedback alone. Invite teammates to help triage requests, respond to users, and keep your roadmap updated. Control who can do what with simple role-based permissions.

## Overview

Access team settings from **Admin → Settings → Team Members**.

## Roles

| Role | Capabilities |

| **Admin** | Full access to all settings, team management, integrations |
| **Member** | Manage feedback, respond to posts, update statuses |

## Invite team members

1. Go to **Admin → Settings → Team Members**
2. Click **"Invite member"**
3. Enter their email address
4. Select a role (Admin or Member)
5. Click **Send invite**

The invitee receives an email with a link to join your workspace.

### Pending Invitations

Pending invitations are shown at the top of the Team Members page. From there you can:
- View who has been invited

## Manage members

### View Team Members

The team page shows:
- Member name and email
- Role badge (Admin/Member)

The member count is displayed at the top of the list.

### Change Role

1. Find the member in the list
2. Click the **...** menu button on the right
3. Select **Make admin** or **Make member**
4. Confirm the change

Changes take effect immediately.

### Remove Member

1. Find the member in the list
2. Click the **...** menu button
3. Select **Remove from team**
4. Confirm removal

Removed members:
- Are converted to a portal user
- Lose access to the admin dashboard
- Can still interact with the public feedback portal
- Their comments and activity history remain

<Warning>
You cannot remove yourself or the last admin.
</Warning>

## Authentication

### Email Authentication

By default, team members sign in with email OTP (magic link).

### OAuth

If configured, team members can sign in with:
- GitHub
- Google

See [OAuth Setup](/auth/oauth) for configuration.

## Best Practices

### Start Small

<Tip>
Begin with a small team of admins. Add members as your feedback volume grows.
</Tip>

### Clear Ownership

Assign specific team members to monitor certain boards or topics.

### Regular Reviews

Periodically review team access:
- Remove members who no longer need access
- Audit admin permissions
- Check for unused invitations

### Use Member Role Appropriately

<Note>
Only grant Admin access to those who need it. Members can handle most day-to-day feedback management.
</Note>
