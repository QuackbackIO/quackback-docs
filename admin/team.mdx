## Overview

Access team settings from **Admin → Settings → Team Members**.

## Roles

## Authentication

### Email Authentication

By default, team members sign in with email OTP (magic link).

### OAuth

If configured, team members can sign in with:
- GitHub
- Google
- Microsoft

See [OAuth Setup](/auth/oauth) for configuration.

### SSO (OIDC)

Connect your corporate identity provider for single sign-on:
- Single Sign-On with Okta, Azure AD, Auth0, Keycloak, etc.
- Centralized access control

See [SSO Setup](/auth/sso) for configuration.

## Best Practices

### Start Small

<Tip>
Begin with a small team of admins. Add members as your feedback volume grows.
</Tip>

### Clear Ownership

Assign specific team members to monitor certain boards or topics.

### Regular Reviews

Periodically review team access:
- Remove members who no longer need access
- Audit admin permissions
- Check for unused invitations

### Use Member Role Appropriately

<Note>
Only grant Admin access to those who need it. Members can handle most day-to-day feedback management.
</Note>

## Team Activity

Track what your team is doing:

- **Post updates** - Who changed statuses
- **Comments** - Official responses from team
- **Settings changes** - Configuration updates (Admin only)

Activity is logged for accountability and audit purposes.

## Transferring Ownership

To transfer workspace ownership:

1. Ensure the new owner is an Admin
2. Contact support for ownership transfer
3. Verify the transfer via email
