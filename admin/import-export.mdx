## Migrate from other platforms

### From UserVoice

1. Export from UserVoice (CSV format)
2. Map columns:
   - `suggestion_title` → `title`
   - `suggestion_text` → `content`
   - `status` → `status`
   - `vote_count` → `vote_count`

### From Canny

1. Export from Canny
2. Map columns:
   - `title` → `title`
   - `details` → `content`
   - `status` → `status`
   - `votes` → `vote_count`

### From Spreadsheet

If you've been tracking feedback in a spreadsheet:

1. Add column headers matching Quackback format
2. Ensure dates are ISO 8601 format
3. Clean up status values to match your status slugs
4. Export as CSV (UTF-8 encoding)

## Best Practices

### Before Import

<Tip>
1. **Create statuses first** - Import matches by slug
2. **Clean your data** - Remove duplicates, fix formatting
3. **Test with sample** - Import a few rows first
4. **Backup existing data** - Export current posts
</Tip>

### Data Cleaning

Common issues to fix:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Extra whitespace | Trim cells |
| Inconsistent statuses | Normalize names |
| HTML in content | Convert to markdown |
| Date formats | Use ISO 8601 |
| Encoding issues | Save as UTF-8 |

### Large Imports

<Warning>
For 5,000+ posts:

1. Split into batches of 2,000
2. Import sequentially
3. Verify each batch
4. Allow time between batches
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid CSV format"

- Check file encoding (use UTF-8)
- Verify proper quoting for fields with commas
- Ensure consistent column count

### "Status not found"

- Create the status before importing
- Check spelling matches exactly

### "Date parse error"

- Use ISO 8601: `2024-01-15T10:30:00Z`
- Or: `2024-01-15` (date only)

### "Import stuck"

- Large files take time
- Check browser console for errors
- Try smaller batches

## Next Steps

- [Boards](/admin/boards) - Manage import targets
- [Statuses](/admin/statuses) - Set up statuses before import
- [Feedback](/admin/inbox) - View imported posts
