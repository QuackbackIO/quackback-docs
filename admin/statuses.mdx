# Managing Statuses

Statuses represent the stages of your feedback workflow. Customize them to match how your team works.

## Overview

Access status settings from **Admin → Settings → Statuses**. The page is titled "Public Statuses" and lets you customize which statuses are available for feedback posts.

## Status Categories

Statuses are organized into three categories:

### Active
Statuses for posts that are being worked on or need attention. These represent different stages of progress before completion.

### Complete
Final statuses for posts that have been successfully addressed. Completed posts are deprioritized when suggesting similar posts.

### Closed
Statuses for posts that won't be implemented. Use these for declined requests, duplicates, or items out of scope.

## Creating a Status

1. Go to **Admin → Settings → Statuses**
2. Find the category you want to add a status to
3. Click **"Add new status"** at the bottom of that category
4. Fill in the details:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Name | Display name (e.g., "In Beta") |
| Slug | API identifier (auto-generated from name) |
| Color | Status badge color (select from palette) |

5. Click **Create status**

## Status Properties

### Name

The display name shown everywhere the status appears. Keep it short and clear.

Examples: `Planned`, `In Progress`, `Shipped`, `Won't Do`

### Color

Click the color dot next to a status to open the color picker. Choose from a palette of colors that visually represents the status.

### Show on Roadmap

Use the toggle switch next to each status to control whether posts with that status appear on the public roadmap.

<Note>
You must select exactly 3 statuses to show on the roadmap. The counter at the top shows how many are currently selected.
</Note>

## Editing a Status

1. Go to **Admin → Settings → Statuses**
2. Click the color dot to change the color
3. Use the toggle to change roadmap visibility
4. Click **Save changes** at the bottom when done

All posts with this status will reflect the changes immediately.

## Reordering Statuses

The status order affects dropdown menu order and roadmap column order.

To reorder:
1. Go to **Admin → Settings → Statuses**
2. Drag statuses using the grip handle on the left
3. Click **Save changes** to apply

## Deleting a Status

1. Go to **Admin → Settings → Statuses**
2. Click the trash icon next to the status
3. Confirm deletion

<Warning>
You cannot delete the default status (marked with a lock icon). Each category must have at least one status.
</Warning>

## Status Workflows

### Simple Workflow

```
Under Review → Planned → In Progress → Shipped
      ↓
   Declined
```

### Detailed Workflow

```
Under Review → Planned → In Design → In Development → In Beta → Shipped
      ↓
   Declined
```

### With Blocking States

```
Under Review → Planned → In Progress → Blocked → In Progress → Shipped
      ↓
   Declined
```

## Tips

### Keep It Simple

<Tip>
Start with the default statuses. Add more only when you have a clear need.

Too many statuses:
- Confuse users
- Create maintenance overhead
- Make the roadmap harder to read
</Tip>

### Clear Naming

Use action-oriented names that describe the current state:
- "In Progress" not "Development"
- "Shipped" not "Done"
- "Under Review" not "New"

### Roadmap Visibility

Only show meaningful statuses on the roadmap. Users don't need to see:
- Internal review stages
- Declined items
- Duplicates

### Status Descriptions

Add descriptions to help team members use statuses consistently:

> **Planned**: Approved for development. Will be scheduled in the next quarter.

> **In Progress**: Currently being worked on by the team.

## Notifications

When a post's status changes:
- Subscribed users receive email notifications
- Integrations (Slack, etc.) are triggered if configured

## Next Steps

- [Feedback](/admin/inbox) - Use statuses to manage feedback
- [Roadmap](/admin/roadmap) - Display status-based roadmaps
- [Integrations](/integrations/overview) - Notify on status changes
