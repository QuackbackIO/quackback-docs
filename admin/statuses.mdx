# Track progress with statuses

Keep users in the loop. Statuses show what's happening with their feedback, from "Open" all the way to "Complete".

When you change a status, subscribers get notified automatically. It's the easiest way to close the feedback loop without sending individual emails.

## Default Statuses

Quackback comes with six statuses organized into three categories:

### Active

Statuses for posts that need attention or are being worked on:

| Status | What it means |
|--------|---------------|
| Open | New feedback (default for new posts) |
| Under Review | Feedback being evaluated |
| Planned | Approved and scheduled |
| In Progress | Currently being worked on |

### Complete

For posts that have been successfully addressed:

| Status | What it means |
|--------|---------------|
| Complete | Released to users |

### Closed

For posts that won't be implemented:

| Status | What it means |
|--------|---------------|
| Closed | Won't be implemented |

<Tip>
Completed and closed posts are deprioritized when suggesting similar posts to new users so old resolved items don't clog up the suggestions.
</Tip>

## Create a status

Your workflow isn't one-size-fits-all. Create custom statuses like "In Design", "In Beta", or "Blocked".

1. Go to **Admin → Settings → Statuses**
2. Find the category you want to add a status to
3. Click **"Add new status"** at the bottom
4. Fill in the details:

| Field | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| Name | Display name (e.g., "In Beta") |
| Slug | API identifier (auto-generated from name) |
| Color | Status badge color |

5. Click **Create status**

## Show on Roadmap

Use the toggle next to each status to control whether posts with that status appear on the public roadmap.

<Note>
You must select exactly 3 statuses to show on the roadmap. The counter at the top shows how many are currently selected.
</Note>

Most teams show: **Planned → In Progress → Complete**

## Reorder statuses

The order affects dropdown menus and roadmap columns.

1. Go to **Admin → Settings → Statuses**
2. Drag statuses using the grip handle on the left
3. Click **Save changes**

## Edit a status

1. Go to **Admin → Settings → Statuses**
2. Click the color dot to change the color
3. Use the toggle to change roadmap visibility
4. Click **Save changes**

All posts with this status will reflect the changes immediately.

## Delete a status

1. Go to **Admin → Settings → Statuses**
2. Click the trash icon next to the status
3. Confirm deletion

<Warning>
You cannot delete the default status for new posts (marked with a lock icon). Each category must have at least one status.
</Warning>

## Communicate status changes

When you update a status, add a comment so users know why. Here are templates you can use:

**Moving to Planned:**
> "Great news! We've added this to our roadmap. Thanks for the suggestion. We'll keep you posted as we make progress."

**Moving to In Progress:**
> "We're actively working on this now. Stay tuned for updates!"

**Moving to Complete:**
> "This is now live! Thanks for suggesting it. Let us know how it works for you."

**Moving to Closed:**
> "After reviewing, we've decided to go a different direction. [Brief reason]. We really appreciate you taking the time to share this idea."

**Reverting to Open:**
> "We're putting this back under review. Priorities shifted, but we haven't forgotten about it."

<Tip>
Switching status back and forth? That's fine. Priorities change. Just add a quick comment explaining why so users don't get confused.
</Tip>

## Example Workflows

### Simple Workflow

```
Open → Under Review → Planned → In Progress → Complete
                ↓
              Closed
```

### Detailed Workflow (with custom statuses)

```
Open → Under Review → Planned → In Design → In Development → In Beta → Complete
              ↓
            Closed
```

### With Blocking States

```
Open → Under Review → Planned → In Progress → Blocked → In Progress → Complete
              ↓
            Closed
```

## Best Practices

### Keep It Simple

<Tip>
Start with the default statuses. Add custom ones only when you feel limited.

Too many statuses:
- Confuse users trying to understand progress
- Create maintenance overhead for your team
- Make the roadmap harder to read
</Tip>

### Use Clear Names

Use action-oriented names that describe the current state:
- "In Progress" not "Development"
- "Complete" not "Done"
- "Open" not "New"

### Roadmap Visibility

Only show meaningful statuses on the roadmap. Users don't need to see:
- Internal review stages
- Closed items
- Duplicates

## Notifications

When a post's status changes:
- Subscribed users receive email notifications (if email is configured)
- Integrations (Slack, etc.) are triggered if you've set up event mappings

## Next Steps

- [Roadmap](/admin/roadmap) - Display status-based roadmaps
- [Inbox](/admin/inbox) - Manage feedback and change statuses
- [Integrations](/integrations/overview) - Get notified on status changes
