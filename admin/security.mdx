# Configure team security

Protect your admin dashboard with the right level of security for your team. Use simple email magic links or require OAuth through GitHub or Google.

## Overview

Team authentication controls how team members (admins and members) sign in to the admin dashboard. By default, email OTP, GitHub, and Google are all enabled.

<Note>
Team authentication controls **team member** sign-in (employees managing feedback). For **portal user** authentication (customers submitting feedback), see [Portal Authentication](/admin/portal-auth).
</Note>

## Team Sign-in Methods

Team members can sign in using the following methods:

### Email (Magic Link)

Allow team members to sign in using magic link codes sent to their email.

- **How it works**: User enters email → receives 6-digit code → enters code to sign in
- **Best for**: Teams without SSO who want passwordless login
- **Enabled by default**: Yes

### GitHub

Allow team members to sign in using their GitHub accounts.

- **How it works**: User clicks "Continue with GitHub" → authorizes access → signed in
- **Best for**: Developer teams already using GitHub
- **Requires**: GitHub OAuth app configured in environment
- **Enabled by default**: Yes

### Google

Allow team members to sign in using their Google accounts.

- **How it works**: User clicks "Continue with Google" → authorizes access → signed in
- **Best for**: Teams using Google Workspace
- **Requires**: Google OAuth credentials configured in environment
- **Enabled by default**: Yes

## OAuth Provider Setup

OAuth providers (GitHub, Google) require environment configuration:

### GitHub

```bash
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

### Google

```bash
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

See [Environment Variables](/reference/environment-variables) for complete configuration.

## Best Practices

### Multi-Factor Authentication

While Quackback doesn't have built-in MFA, you can achieve equivalent security by:

- Using OAuth providers that require MFA (GitHub, Google)

### Principle of Least Privilege

- Review team member access regularly
- Only grant Admin role to those who need full settings access

### Secure Defaults

<Tip>
For most teams, we recommend:

1. Enable **Email** for backup access
2. Enable **one OAuth provider** that matches your workflow (GitHub for devs, Google for business)
</Tip>
