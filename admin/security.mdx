# Security

Protect your admin dashboard with the right level of security for your team. Use simple email magic links, require OAuth through GitHub or Google, or enforce enterprise SSO.

## Overview

Access Security settings from **Admin → Settings → Security**. Choose which authentication methods your team can use.

<Note>
Security settings control **team member** authentication (employees managing feedback). For **portal user** authentication (customers submitting feedback), see [Portal Authentication](/admin/portal-auth).
</Note>

## Team Sign-in Methods

Toggle which authentication methods team members can use to sign in:

### Email (Magic Link)

Allow team members to sign in using magic link codes sent to their email.

- **How it works**: User enters email → receives 6-digit code → enters code to sign in
- **Best for**: Teams without SSO who want passwordless login
- **Enabled by default**: Yes

### GitHub

Allow team members to sign in using their GitHub accounts.

- **How it works**: User clicks "Continue with GitHub" → authorizes access → signed in
- **Best for**: Developer teams already using GitHub
- **Requires**: GitHub OAuth app configured in environment

### Google

Allow team members to sign in using their Google accounts.

- **How it works**: User clicks "Continue with Google" → authorizes access → signed in
- **Best for**: Teams using Google Workspace
- **Requires**: Google OAuth credentials configured in environment

## Configuring Sign-in Methods

1. Navigate to **Admin → Settings → Security**
2. Toggle each method on or off using the switches
3. Changes save automatically

<Warning>
At least one authentication method must remain enabled. The last enabled method cannot be disabled.
</Warning>

## OAuth Provider Setup

OAuth providers (GitHub, Google) require environment configuration:

### GitHub

```bash
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

### Google

```bash
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

See [Environment Variables](/reference/environment-variables) for complete configuration.

## Enterprise SSO

For enterprise single sign-on (SAML, OIDC) with your identity provider, see the [SSO documentation](/auth/sso).

<Tip>
Enterprise SSO allows you to enforce authentication through your corporate identity provider (Okta, Azure AD, Auth0, etc.).
</Tip>

## Best Practices

### Multi-Factor Authentication

While Quackback doesn't have built-in MFA, you can achieve equivalent security by:

- Using OAuth providers that require MFA (GitHub, Google)
- Configuring SSO with your identity provider's MFA policies

### Principle of Least Privilege

- Enable only the authentication methods your team actually uses
- Use SSO to enforce corporate authentication policies
- Review team member access regularly

### Secure Defaults

<Tip>
For most teams, we recommend:

1. Enable **Email** for backup access
2. Enable **one OAuth provider** that matches your workflow (GitHub for devs, Google for business)
3. Or configure **SSO** to use your corporate identity provider
</Tip>

## Access Control

Only **Admins** can modify security settings.

| Role | Can View | Can Modify |
|------|----------|------------|
| Admin | Yes | Yes |
| Member | No | No |

## Next Steps

- [Portal Authentication](/admin/portal-auth) - Configure how portal users sign in
- [Team Members](/admin/team) - Manage your team
- [SSO](/auth/sso) - Set up enterprise single sign-on
