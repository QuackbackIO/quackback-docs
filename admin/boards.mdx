## Tips

### Board Organization

<Tip>
**Keep it simple** - Start with 2-3 boards. You can always add more later.

**Clear names** - Use descriptive names so users know where to post.

**Logical separation** - Separate by type (features vs bugs) or area (mobile vs web).
</Tip>

### Private Boards

Use private boards for:
- Internal team feedback
- Beta feature requests
- Enterprise customer feedback

### Migration

When migrating from another platform:

1. Export data from the old platform
2. Format as CSV with required columns
3. Import into appropriate boards
4. Verify vote counts and dates imported correctly
