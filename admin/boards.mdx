# Organize feedback with boards

Keep feature requests separate from bug reports. Boards let you organize feedback the way that makes sense for your product.

## Why Use Multiple Boards?

Without boards, everything piles up in one place. Your team wastes time sorting through noise, and users don't know where to post.

Common board setups:
- **Feature Requests** + **Bug Reports** - Simple and effective
- **Feature Requests** + **Bug Reports** + **Integrations** - When you have lots of integration requests
- **Mobile** + **Web** + **API** - Separate by platform

<Tip>
Start with just 2-3 boards. You can always add more later, but too many boards confuse users about where to post.
</Tip>

## Create a board

1. Go to **Admin → Settings → Boards**
2. Click **"New board"**
3. Fill in the details:

| Field | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| Board name | Display name (e.g., "Feature Requests") |
| Description | Optional text shown on the board page |
| Public board | Toggle to make it visible to everyone |

4. Click **Create board**

<Note>
The URL slug is automatically generated from the board name. For example, "Feature Requests" becomes `/b/feature-requests`.
</Note>

## Board Settings

Select a board to see its settings. You'll find tabs for:

### General Tab

Edit the board's basic information:
- **Board name** - The display name
- **Description** - Optional description

The Danger Zone at the bottom lets you delete the board.

### Access Tab

Control board visibility:
- **Public** - Anyone can view this board on your portal. Signed-in users can vote, comment, and submit feedback.
- **Private** - Only team members can view this board.

### Import Data Tab

Import posts from a CSV file into this board. See [Import & Export](/admin/import-export) for format details.

### Export Data Tab

Download all posts from this board as CSV.

## Edit a board

1. Go to **Admin → Settings → Boards**
2. Select the board from the dropdown
3. Navigate to the **General** tab
4. Update settings
5. Click **Save changes**

## Delete a board

1. Go to **Admin → Settings → Boards**
2. Select the board
3. Go to the **General** tab
4. Scroll to the Danger Zone
5. Click **Delete board** and confirm

<Warning>
Deleting a board also deletes all posts in that board. This cannot be undone.
</Warning>

## Need to Keep Feedback Internal?

Use private boards for:
- Internal team feedback
- Beta feature requests
- Enterprise customer feedback

Private boards are only visible to team members.

## Migrate from another platform?

If you're moving from Canny, Nolt, or another tool:

1. Export data from the old platform as CSV
2. Format to match Quackback's import format
3. Go to **Admin → Settings → Boards** → select board → **Import Data**
4. Verify vote counts and dates imported correctly

<Tip>
Import into a test board first to verify everything looks right, then delete and re-import to the real board.
